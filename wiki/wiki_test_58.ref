Imagined interaction
Imagined interactions (IIs) are a type of social cognition and mental imagery grounded in symbolic interactionism in which individuals imagine conversations with significant others for a variety of purposes (Honeycutt, 2003; 2015).
The research program was founded and created by James M. Honeycutt in 1987, who was designated an LSU Distinguished Professor in 2012.
He provided a keynote address at the American Association for the Study of Mental Imagery at Yale University in 1987 discussing the functions of imagined interactions and mental imagery.
The book, "Imagined Interactions: Daydreaming about Communication" by Honeycutt (2003) which was designated a distinguished book by the National Communication Association in 2006 for formulating the original formulations and the II construct has provided a beneficial mechanism for operationalizing the study of intrapersonal communication, social cognition, daydreaming, and mental imagery.
Furthermore, imagined interactions can be used in sports imagery as athletes "imagine" positive outcomes of their executions on specific plays or formations (Keaton, Gearhart, & Honeycutt, 2014).
==========
In the early research, IIs were suggested as a means to operationalize the study of daydreaming as it works to shape communication interpersonally, emotions, and personality.
They have been examined cross-culturally (McCann, Honeycutt, & Keaton, 2010).
Scripts are activated mindlessly and created through imagined interactions, as people envision contingency plans for actions.
In contrast to mindless processing, engaging in imagined interaction requires conscious cognitive processing.
Imagined interactions are a type of daydreaming that have definitive attributes and serve a number of functions including rehearsal, self-understanding, relational maintenance, managing conflict, catharsis, and compensation.
Retroactive imagined interactions often occur in television shows in terms of “flashbacks” as characters relive prior conversations in their mind.
Honeycutt et al.
(1989) discuss how IIs have their theoretical foundation in the work of symbolic interactionists and phenemonologists, including Mead (1934), Dewey (1922) and Schutz (1962).
As individuals engage in imagined interactions, cognitive scripts are activated as people imagine how they might react in an upcoming conversation.
Imagined interactions help people prepare for encounters.
They also help people to relive previous conversations and foster good or bad memories.
==========
Within imagined interaction theory, Honeycutt (2003) defines eight attributes or characteristics of IIs that can be measured as personality traits or contextually in various situations or with specific individuals.
For example, while a person may have a lot of IIs in their daily life, they may have IIs while doing their job or a particular task.
Having IIs while playing tennis would interfere with serving and returning the ball.
Specifically, the eight attributes include the following:
1.
Frequency—How often a person has IIs ranging from rarely to quite frequently.
For example, lonely people have fewer IIs because they have fewer interaction scenes to access compared to nonlonely people (Honeycutt, 2003).
2.
Proactivity—Proactivity refers to those IIs which are engaged in prior to actual interaction, and research has shown that such IIs tend to occur prior to actual interactions.
For example, a worker may desire a raise, so she decides to approach her boss concerning the matter.
Using an II proactively, she may visualize herself going into her boss’s office and may even devise a plan for what she will say.
This is an example of a proactive II.
3.
Retroactivity— Retroactivity refers to reviewing an interaction after it has taken place.
These are referred to as “flashbacks” in drama.
Proactive and retroactive IIs can simultaneously occur so that conversations are linked together and themes of interpersonal relationships emerge (Honeycutt, 2014).
For example, in order to characterize a relationship as competitive or hostile with another person, the person recalls more conversations in which disagreements were communicated as opposed to pleasant, cooperative transactions (Honeycutt, 2010).
4.
Variety—Variety refers to the diversity of topics and partners within IIs.
IIs which involve various topics are related to the imaginer’s internal locus of control as well, and this finding lends credence to the idea that the chronically lonely lack variety in their IIs.
However, a person may have IIs with a variety of partners on few topics (e.g., Football plays and strategies are more likely to be the focus of discussion among a team's coaches while in practice in order not be distracted).
5.
Discrepancy—IIs can be similar to or different from relevant interaction.
Discrepancy is the II characteristic that provides for the incongruity between IIs and the actual interaction which they address.
Research suggests that individuals who are chronically lonely have highly discrepant IIs, which researchers suggest serves to perpetuate their lonely state (Honeycutt, 2003).
Lonely people have limited prior interactions upon which to base their IIs, so imagined interactions they experience prior to new interaction are likely to be high in discrepancy.
6.
Self-Dominance—This attribute addresses who is more prominent in the II; self, both, or other.
Research also suggests that a person engaging in IIs concerned with matters of conflict will likely find the self being more dominant than the II partner.
have found tends to characterize collectivistic cultures including Japan compared to individualistic cultures such as America.
7.
Valence—Valence reflects how positive or negative emotions are experienced while imagining the conversation.
High valence reflects positive emotional affect while low valence reflects negative emotions such as anger, sadness, pity or disgust.
Honeycutt (2003) reviews research indicating that females report having more pleasant IIs.
Those experiencing less pleasantness in their IIs report higher levels of self-dominance.
8.
Specificity—The final attribute is specificity reflecting the degree of verbal and visual imagery used in the II.
This attribute reflects the level of detail and distinction of images contained within IIs.
Honeycutt (1998–99) found that those individuals reporting a secure attachment style experience high levels of detailed visual and verbal imagery, suggesting high levels of specificity.
==========
Imagined interactions function in the following ways: (1) they keep a relationship alive; (2) they maintain conflict as well as resolving it; (3) they are used to rehearse messages for future interaction; (4) they aid people in self-understanding through clarifying thoughts and feelings; (5) they provide emotional catharsis by relieving tension; and (6) they compensate for lack of real interaction (Honeycutt, 2003; 2008).
1.
Relational Maintenance: People often imagine talking with others that are important in their lives.
Additionally, increased uses of proactive and retroactive IIs aided the ability of imagined interactions to predict relational quality.
Additionally, relational satisfaction was simultaneously predicted by extraversion and being a judger based on the Myers-Brigg personality inventory in which judging reflect placing a premium on organized environments, competence, performance and independence.
2.
Conflict Linkage: For some people, they are obsessed with grudges while others think about how to improve areas of disagreement.
Conflict linkage is also referred to as conflict management.
However, as noted in some of the theorems of imagined interaction conflict-linkage theory which are highlighted below (e.g., theorem four explains rage).
Honeycutt (2004; 2011) explains how conflict linkage is associated with rumination in which people dwell on conflicts and obsessively think about them which is related to depression.
The second function of conflict linkage has received a great deal of research attention as it explains how individuals often remember arguments that are many years old and it is difficult for them to "let go."
As a result, they harbor old grudges.
A series of three axioms (e.g., "The communication is the relationship") and nine theorems are discussed explaining how daily conflict is managed or destructively dealt with (see Honeycutt, 2003-2004 for a review).
The table below contains an outline of the axioms behind managing conflict in personal relationships and resulting theorems have been empirically tested in social scientific studies.
3.
Rehearsal: People plan their messages and what they are going to say as well as anticipating what others will say to them and how the self will respond.
Rehearsal often helps people in quickly developing contingencies when plans do not go as expected.
4.
Self-Understanding: People have IIs in order to understand their beliefs about values, attitudes, or the opinions they have.
IIs allow people to clarify their own thoughts and promote understanding of their own views.
5.
Catharsis: People use IIs to relieve tension and anxiety which further reduces uncertainty.
IIs provide a mechanism to internally get “things off of one’s chest” and release emotions.
6.
Compensation: IIs are used to substitute for real conversations.
If you do not have access to another person, you compensate for the lack communication by imagining conversations with the persons.
The compensation function is rampant during electrical outages or when cell phone towers are blown down during tornadoes, hurricanes, or other environmental diasasters (Honeycutt and Mapp 2011).
==========
Honeycutt, Pence, and Gearhart (2013) examined the associations between II attributes and the Big Five personality traits.
In terms of personality, IIs have trait characteristics to the extent they are enduring and stable across similar conditions.
Conversely, they can also be measured in terms of state attributes in which their usage would be higher or lower depending on the particular context.
The Big Five Personality Traits include neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.
Honeycutt and his associates found that the frequency and proactivity attributes of imagined interactions are associated with lack of neuroticism and openness to new ideas.
Neuroticism increases egocentrism, depression, and anxiety (Hamilton, Buck, Chory, Beatty, & Patrylak, 2009)).
Highly anxious people have fewer IIs available to them to “predict” their perceived (or believed) unstable environment.
They also found that having non-discrepant IIs that are pleasant with the self talking more in the II is moderately associated with the personality dimensions of extraversion and conscientiousness.
Extraverts interact with more individuals than do introverts, so extraverts would therefore imagine themselves having these interactions more often than those who are not extraverted.
Likewise, they discovered that extraverts have more pleasant IIs, which may be explained through another relationship between extraversion and narcissism.
Extraverts think highly of themselves, and most likely portray themselves in a pleasant manner in their imagined interactions.
Correspondence between II Attributes and Functions
Although II theory has been a productive concept for research on communication and social cognition, there is an underlying and yet untested assumption within II theory that the eight attributes are related to all six functions and that II functions can be compared and contrasted in terms of II attributes.
Bodie, Honeycutt, and Vickery (2013) conducted two studies exploring the multidimensional nature of functions and attributes.
The first study revealed both corroborative and counter evidence for II theory.
In line with the internal structure of II theory, it was found that conflict linkage and catharsis IIs are more negatively valenced than those used for compensation and relational maintenance.
Rehearsal IIs are more likely to be discrepant than all functions except relational maintenance and are the most proactive.
When compared to all other functions, compensatory IIs contain references to more people and were more frequent.
It also appears that compensatory and relational maintenance functions are similar insofar as each is equally directed to others and highly specific, providing support for the role of each in close interpersonal relationships (Honeycutt 2003).
Relational maintenance and conflict IIs were used just as frequently as those for catharsis, and relational maintenance IIs were directed toward others in an equivalent manner as those used for conflict.
