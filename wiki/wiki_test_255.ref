Vishnu Puran (TV series)
Vishnu Puran is an Indian television series directed by B. R. Chopra.
It aired in 2003.
It is based on the "Srimad Bhagavat Mahapuran", an ancient collection of stories and scripture.
"Vishnu Puran" tells of 10 incarnations of Lord Shri Vishnu, as well as other stories, such as the Legend of Dhruva.
The chief roles are played by Nitish Bharadwaj as Lord Shri Vishnu and Vaidehi as Goddess Lakshmi.
Nitish Bharadwaj previously played the role of Lord Shri Vishnu's eighth incarnation, Lord Krishna, in Chopra's television adaptation of the epic "Mahabharat".
The music is composed by Rajkamal who also worked on "Mahabharat".

Lord Indra goes to Lord Shiva to prevent this, but Shukracharya attracts Lord Shiva's attention first and earns the right to attempt Shiva's penance to obtain the mantra: to hang upside down from a tree, without eating, drinking or speaking, and breathing only the smoke of burning leaves, for one year.

Lord Indra must obtain the cooperation of the danava.
Episode 15: Lord Indra points out to Shukracharya that when he dies, he won't be able to use the Sanjeevani Mantra on himself and the danava advantage will be lost.
