Former judges Whitney Port and Julien Macdonald did not come back for the new series.

Guest judges were no longer a deciding factor during eliminations, and the power lied solely in the main judges' hands.
The cycle featured fourteen contestants in its final cast.
Additionally, a new elimination process was implemented.
At panel, the judges went straight into deliberation without having evaluated each contestant individually.
Furthermore, there were multiple contestants in danger of elimination each week as opposed to the usual two in seasons past.

The winner of the competition was 23-year-old Lauren Lambert from Wallington, Surrey, England.

However, only 27 of them were revealed to the public.
