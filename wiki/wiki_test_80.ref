Battle of Cowpens
The Battle of Cowpens (January 17, 1781) was a battle fought by Continental Army forces under Brigadier General Daniel Morgan in South Carolina against the British Army led by Colonel Banastre Tarleton, during the Southern campaign of the American Revolutionary War.
It was a turning point in the patriots' reconquest of South Carolina from British control.
It took place in northwestern Cherokee County, South Carolina, north of the town of Cowpens.
==========
On October 14, 1780, George Washington chose Nathanael Greene to be commander of the Southern Department of the Continental forces.
Greene's task was not an easy one.
The Carolinas had been the scene of a long string of disasters for the Continental Army in 1780, the worst being the capture of one American army at the Siege of Charleston and the destruction of another at the Battle of Camden.
A victory of Patriot militia over their Loyalist counterparts at the Battle of Kings Mountain in October had bought time, but most of South Carolina was still occupied by the British.
When Greene took command, the southern army numbered only 2307 men (on paper, 1482 present), of whom just 949 were Continental regulars.
On December 3, Brigadier General Daniel Morgan reported for duty to Greene's headquarters at Charlotte, North Carolina.
At the start of the Revolution, Morgan, whose military experience dated to the French and Indian War, had served at the Siege of Boston.
Later he participated in the 1775 invasion of Canada and its climactic battle, the Battle of Quebec.
That battle, on December 31, 1775, ended in defeat and Morgan's capture by the British.
Morgan was exchanged in January 1777 and placed by George Washington in command of a picked force of 500 trained riflemen, known as Morgan's Riflemen.
Morgan and his men played a key role in the victory at Saratoga, which proved to be a turning point of the entire war.
Bitter after being passed over for promotion and plagued by severe attacks of sciatica, Morgan left the army in 1779.
A year later he was promoted to Brigadier General and returned to service in the Southern Department.
Greene decided that his weak army was unable to meet the British in a stand-up fight.
He made the unconventional decision to divide his army, sending a detachment west of the Catawba River to raise the morale of the locals and find supplies beyond the limited amounts available around Charlotte.
Greene gave Morgan command of this wing and instructed him to join with the militia west of the Catawba and take command of them.
Morgan headed west on December 21, charged with taking position between the Broad and Pacolet Rivers, and protecting the civilians in that area.
He had 600 men, some 400 of which were Continentals, the rest being Virginia militia with experience as Continentals.
By Christmas Day Morgan had reached the Pacolet River.
He was joined by 60 South Carolina militia led by the experienced partisan Andrew Pickens.
Other militia from Georgia and the Carolinas joined Morgan's camp.
Meanwhile, Lord Cornwallis was planning to return to North Carolina and conduct the invasion that he had postponed after the defeat at Kings Mountain.
Morgan's force represented a threat to his left.
Additionally, Cornwallis received incorrect intelligence claiming that Morgan was going to attack the important British fort at Ninety Six, in western South Carolina.
Seeking to save the fort and defeat Morgan's command, Cornwallis on January 2 ordered Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton to the west.
Tarleton was 26 years old and had enjoyed a spectacular career in his service with the British in the colonies.
In December 1776, he and a small party surprised and captured Patriot Gen. Charles Lee in New Jersey.
He served with distinction at the Siege of Charleston and the Battle of Camden.
Commanding the British Legion, a mixed infantry/cavalry force composed of American Loyalists who constituted some of the best British troops in the Carolinas, Tarleton won victories at Monck's Corner and Fishing Creek.
He became infamous among Patriots after his victory at the Battle of Waxhaws.
His men had killed American soldiers after they had surrendered.
In Tarleton's account published in 1781, he stated that his horse had been shot from under him during the initial charge and his men, thinking him dead, engaged in "a vindictive asperity not easily restrained."
Tarleton and the Legion marched to Ninety Six, learning Morgan was not there, but Tarleton decided to pursue his forces.
Tarleton asked for reinforcements of British regulars, which Cornwallis sent.
Tarleton set out with his enlarged command to drive Morgan across the Broad River.
On January 12 he received accurate news of Morgan's location and continued with hard marching, building boats to cross rivers that were flooding with winter rains.
Receiving word that Tarleton was in hot pursuit, Morgan retreated north, to avoid being trapped between Tarleton and Cornwallis.
By the afternoon of the 16th, Morgan was approaching the Broad River, which was high with flood waters and reported difficult to cross.
He knew Tarleton was close behind.
By nightfall he had reached a place called the Cowpens, a well-known grazing area for local cattle.
Pickens, who had been patrolling, arrived that night with a large body of militia.
Morgan decided to stand and fight rather than continue to retreat and risk being caught by Tarleton while fording the Broad River.
Learning of Morgan's location, Tarleton pushed his troops, marching at 3 a.m. instead of camping for the night.
==========
The size of the American force at Cowpens remains in dispute.
Morgan claimed in his official report to have had few more than 800 men at Cowpens, which is substantially supported by historian John Buchanan, whose estimate is between 800 and 1000 men.
In contrast historian Lawrence E. Babits, in his detailed study of the battle, estimates the strength of Morgan's command on the day of the battle was closer to 1,900, composed of:
Babits' figures can be summarized as: 82 Continental light dragoons; 55 state dragoons; 45 militia dragoons; 300 Continental infantry; about 150 state infantry and 1,255-1,280 militia infantry, for a total of 1,887–1,912 officers and men.
Broken down by state, there were about 855 South Carolinians; 442 Virginians; 290–315 North Carolinians; 180 Marylanders; 60 Georgians and 60 Delawareans.
Morgan's forces were strengthened due to core elements of relatively seasoned troops and his own brilliance in leadership.
His Continentals were veterans, and many of his militia, which included some Overmountain Men, had fought at the Battle of Musgrove Mill and the Battle of Kings Mountain.
The experienced British forces (and particularly their relatively young commander) were accustomed, especially in the Southern Theater, to easily routing often 'green' militia, and thus could have underestimated the opposition.
==========
Tarleton's force included:
A total of over 1,150 officers and men.
Broken down by troop classification, there were 300 cavalry, 553 regulars, 24 artillerymen and 281 militia.
Tarleton’s men from the Royal Artillery, 17th Light Dragoons, 7th Regiment (Royal Fusliers), 16th Regiment and 71st Regiment were reliable and good soldiers: .
Tarleton's own unit, the British Legion were formidable "in a pursuit situation" but had an uncertain reputation "when faced with determined opposition".
==========
Daniel Morgan used the landscape of Cowpens, the varying reliability of his troops, his opponent’s expectations, and the time available before Tarleton's arrival to his advantage.
He knew untrained militiamen, which composed a large portion of his force, were generally unreliable in battle, and in the past had routed at the first hint of battle and abandoned the regulars.
(The Battle of Camden had ended in disaster when the militia, which was half of the American force, broke and ran as soon as the shooting started.)
To eliminate that possibility, he defied convention by placing his army between the Broad and Pacolet Rivers, thus making escape impossible if the army was routed.
Selecting a low hill as the center of his position, he placed his Continental infantry on it, deliberately leaving his flanks exposed to his opponent.
With a ravine on their right flank and a creek on their left flank, Morgan reasoned his forces were protected against British flanking maneuvers at the beginning of the battle.
Morgan reasoned that Tarleton would be highly confident and attack him head on.
He arranged his troops to encourage this.
He set up three lines of soldiers: one of skirmishers (sharpshooters); one of militia; and a main one.
The first was 150 select skirmishers were from North Carolina (Major McDowell) and Georgia (Major Cunningham).
The second line, behind the skirmishers but in front of the third line of Continentals, consisted of 300 militiamen under the command of Andrew Pickens.
The effect was the conspicuous placement of weak militia in the center front, which would be taken as a fatal weakness and encourage the British to attack there.
The skirmishers and militia would screen the strongest Continental troops, while inflicting damage as the British advanced.
Morgan asked the militia to fire two volleys, something they could achieve, and then withdraw to the left, to re-form in the rear, behind the third line, under cover of the reserve light dragoons (mounted infantry) commanded by William Washington and James McCall.
The militia commander, Colonel A. Pickens, would execute, in effect, a feigned rout which would further embolden the British.
The third line, on the hill, was manned by his best troops: about 550 men consisting of Continentals from Delaware and Maryland, and experienced militiamen from Georgia and Virginia.
Colonel John Eager Howard commanded the Continentals and Colonels Tate and Triplett commanded the experienced militia.
The third line could be expected to stand and hold against the British force.
Morgan expected that the British advancing uphill would be disorganized, and weakened both physically and psychologically by the first two lines, before engaging the third.
The third line would also withdraw a short distance to add to the appearance of rout.
In developing his tactics at Cowpens, as historian John Buchanan wrote, Morgan may have been "the only general in the American Revolution, on either side, to produce a significant original tactical thought."
==========
At 2:00 a.m. on January 17, 1781, Tarleton roused his troops and continued his march to Cowpens.
Lawrence Babits states that, "in the five days before Cowpens, the British were subjected to stress that could only be alleviated by rest and proper diet".
He points out that "in the forty-eight hours before the battle, the British ran out of food and had less than four hours’ sleep".
Over the whole period, Tarleton’s brigade did a great deal of rapid marching across difficult terrain.
Babits concludes that they reached the battlefield exhausted and malnourished.
Tarleton sensed victory and nothing would persuade him to delay.
His Tory scouts had told him of the countryside Morgan was fighting on, and he was certain of success because Morgan's soldiers, mostly militiamen, seemed to be caught between mostly experienced British troops and a flooding river.
As soon as he reached the spot, Tarleton formed a battle line, which consisted of dragoons on his flanks, with his two grasshopper cannons in between the British Regulars and American Loyalists.
Tarleton’s plan was simple and direct.
Most of his infantry (including that of the Legion) would be assembled in linear formation and move directly upon Morgan.
The right and left flanks of this line would be protected by dragoon units.
In reserve were the 250-man battalion of Scottish Highlanders (71st Regiment of Foot), commanded by Major Arthur MacArthur, a professional soldier of long experience who had served in the Dutch Scotch Brigade.
Finally, Tarleton kept the 200-man cavalry contingent of his Legion ready to be unleashed when the Americans broke and ran.
==========
Morgan's stratagem worked perfectly.
The British drove in successive lines, anticipating victory only to encounter another, stronger line after exerting themselves and suffering casualties.
The depth of the American lines gradually soaked up the shock of the British advance.
A few minutes before sunrise, Tarleton's van emerged from the woods in front of the American position.
Tarleton ordered his dragoons to attack the first line of skirmishers, who opened fire and shot fifteen dragoons.
The dragoons promptly retreated, whereupon Tarleton immediately ordered an infantry charge, without pausing to study the American deployment or to allow the rest of his infantry and his cavalry reserve to make it out of the woods.
Tarleton attacked the skirmish line without pausing, deploying his main body and his two grasshopper cannons.
The American skirmishers kept firing as they withdrew to join the second line manned by Pickens' militia.
The British attacked again, this time reaching the militiamen, who (as ordered) poured two volleys into the enemy.
The British—with 40% of their casualties being officers—were astonished and confused.
They reformed and continued to advance.
Tarleton ordered one of his officers, Ogilvie, to charge with some dragoons into the "defeated" Americans.
His men moved forward in regular formation and were momentarily checked by the militia musket fire but continued to advance.
Pickens' militia filed around the American left to the rear as planned after getting off their second volley.
Taking the withdrawal of the first two lines as a full blown retreat, the British advanced headlong into the third and final line of disciplined regulars which awaited them on the hill.
The 71st Highlanders were ordered to flank the American right.
John Eager Howard spotted the flanking movement and ordered the Virginia militiamen manning the American right to turn and face the Scots.
However, in the noise of battle Howard's order was misunderstood and the militiamen began to withdraw.
It was now 7:45 am and the British had been fighting for nearly an hour.
They were tired and disorganized, but they saw the militia withdrawing and believed the Americans were on the run.
They charged, breaking formation and advancing in a chaotic mass.
Morgan ordered a volley.
Howard's militia stopped their withdrawal and made an about-face.
The Virginians fired into the British at a range of no more than thirty yards, with deadly effect, causing the confused British to lurch to a halt.
John Eager Howard shouted, "Charge bayonets!"
The Continentals, as ordered, mounted a bayonet charge.
Tarleton's force, faced with a terrible surprise, began to collapse; some men surrendering on the spot, while others turned and ran.
Howard's men charged forward and seized the British cannons.
William Washington's cavalry came around from behind the American left to hit the British on their right flank and rear.
Pickens' militia, having re-formed, charged out from behind the hill—completing a 360-degree circle around the American position—to hit the 71st Highlander Scots on the British left flank and rear.
Howard ordered the Virginia militia, whose withdrawal had brought on the British charge, to turn about and attack the Scots from the other direction.
The shock of the sudden charge, coupled with the reappearance of the American militiamen on the left flank where Tarleton's exhausted men expected to see their own cavalry, proved too much for the British.
Nearly half of the British and Loyalist infantrymen fell to the ground whether they were wounded or not.
Their will to fight was gone.
Historian Lawrence Babits diagnoses "combat shock" as the cause for this abrupt British collapse—the effects of exhaustion, hunger and demoralization suddenly catching up with them.
Caught in a clever double envelopment that has been compared with the Battle of Cannae, many of the British surrendered.
With Tarleton's right flank and center line collapsed, only a minority of the 71st Highlanders were putting up a fight against part of Howard's line.
Tarleton, realizing the desperate nature of what was occurring, rode back to his one unit that was whole, the Legion Cavalry.
He ordered them to charge, but they refused and fled the field.
The Highlanders, surrounded by militia and Continentals, surrendered.
Desperate to save something, Tarleton found about forty cavalrymen and with them tried to save the two cannons his forces had brought, but they had been taken.
With a few remaining horsemen Tarleton rode back into the fight, but after clashing with Washington’s men, he too retreated from the field.
He was stopped by Washington, who attacked him with his saber, calling out, "Where is now the boasting Tarleton?".
A cornet of the 17th, Thomas Patterson, rode up to strike Washington but was shot by Washington's orderly trumpeter.
Tarleton shot Washington's horse from under him and fled, ending the battle.
It was 8 a.m. and the Battle of Cowpens had lasted approximately one hour.
