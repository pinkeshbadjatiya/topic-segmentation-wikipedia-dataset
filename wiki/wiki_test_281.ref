"Just Dance" is written by Gaga and Akon with co-writing by RedOne, who also produced the track.
In an interview with "Heat" Gaga explained her inspiration for writing the song.
She said, "I was very hung-over.
I wrote the song in about 10 minutes with [producer] RedOne.
And it was my first time being in a Hollywood studio.
Very pristine, big huge room with giant speakers."
Gaga wrote "Just Dance" during January 2008 and according to her it was "hard work and a lot of people didn't believe in it at first".
Later, Gaga reflected on the song by saying,
"That record saved my life.
I was in such a dark space in New York.
I was so depressed, always in a bar.
I got on a plane to LA to do my music and was given one shot to write the song that would change my life and I did.
I never went back.
I left behind my boyfriend, my apartment.
I still haven't been back.
My mother went in and cleared it for me."
In an interview with Contactmusic.com Gaga explained that "Just Dance" is a happy record and is supposed to be appreciated by people going through rough times like losing jobs and homes etc.
Gaga further explained with Artistdirect that she wanted to write a beautiful record with "Just Dance".
Being asked the reason for which "Just Dance" has become popular, Gaga said that she thought, "Everyone is looking for a song that really speaks to the joy in our souls and in our hearts and having a good time.
It's just one of those records.
It feels really good, and when you listen to it, it makes you feel good inside.
It's as simple as that.
I don't think it's rocket science when it comes to the heart.
I think it's a heart theme song."
In March 2010, the song was released as downloadable content for the music-based videogame series "Rock Band", alongside "Poker Face", "Monster" and "Bad Romance" as part of "Lady Gaga Pack 01".

"Just Dance" is an uptempo dance-pop and synthpop song.
The song combines synths of clipped marching beats, soaring electronics and contains mild R&B infused beats.
It is written in the key of C minor and is set at a moderate dance tempo of 119 beats per minute.
Gaga's vocal spans from the low note of G to the high note of C. The song begins with a fast tempo following by the synth arrangement and Gaga uttering "RedOne".
"Just Dance" has a basic progression of Cm–E–B–Fm.
Colby O'Donis sings the interlude in the same range as Gaga followed by an R&B influenced interlude by her, after which the chorus is repeated with O'Donis providing backup vocals and the marching beats.
The song ends with an echoing of the word "dance".
Lyrically, "Just Dance" throws a partial tongue-in-cheek perspective with lyrics like "What's going on on the floor?
/ I love this record, baby but I can't see straight anymore".
The lyrics deal with being completely intoxicated at a party.
The opening lyric "A RedOne" has often been misinterpreted as "red wine" but in actuality is a reference to producer RedOne.

The song has garnered mostly positive reviews.
Matthew Chisling of AllMusic described the song as "a powerhouse of dance waves and infectiously produced beats".
Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" called it a "beguilingly compulsive tale of pulling a drug-induced whitey, with a combination of clipped marching beats, sawing electronics and mild R&B flavor that bears a vague resemblance to Nelly Furtado's "Maneater".
Ben Norman of About.com said that the song "opens the album like a valkyrie leading the charge [...] riding triumphant ahead of her army.
If you don't know this song, use your browser.
I won't waste time explaining what it sounds like."
However he also noted that the song is not groundbreaking and compared it to the music of Rihanna, Chris Brown and The Pussycat Dolls.
Bill Lamb from About.com called the song tame but catchy enough for Gaga to be noticed by mainstream.
He also added that "'Just Dance' has strong energy and features Lady GaGa's striking voice, but it ultimately adds up to rather bland dance-pop."
Colby O' Donis' smooth vocals were also complimented.
Evan Sawdey of PopMatters.com said that "Just Dance" is an intensely catchy single and is an excellent indicator of what the album was all about.
Ben Hogwood of MusicOMH praised the song saying, "You won't get many more catchy party odes than the chart topping Just Dance this year, a polished gem set to lodge in your head for the next few weeks."
Freedom lu Lac of "The Washington Post" described the song to be "filled with mindlessly frothy synth-pop that matches low-grade dance grooves with GaGa's icy, almost disembodied vocals about dancing bliss".
Lynn Saxberg from "The Ottawa Citizen", while reviewing Gaga's The Fame Ball Tour, called the song a perfect sing-along club anthem.
Sal Cinquemani from "Slant Magazine" wrote that the song resembles the "desperate train wreck you're likely to encounter getting wasted at any dive on the L.E.S.
at four in the morning" as is emphasized by the lyrics.
Talia Kranes from BBC called the song irresistible and said that "the catchiness of her songs is sure to cement her place in the list of pop idols".

Released in May 2008, the video was directed by music video director Melina Matsoukas, and is based on the thematic content of the song of being in a party.
The video begins with Gaga arriving with her background dancers at a house party, which seems to have ended.
One of the dancers puts a Discolite Boombox on, blaring the music through the house.
The crowd at the party appear to be sleeping in different areas, and are awoken by the music.
They all start to dance, and scenes of the party are inter cut with scenes of a scantily dressed Gaga dancing in a poncho, with a disco ball or in a small rubber pool playing with an inflated killer whale.
She wears a blue, lightning-bolt shaped sticker beneath her right eye like that on the single cover, which paid tribute to the album cover of David Bowie's "Aladdin Sane", as he is one of her musical idols.
O'Donis appears in the video being flanked by several girls during the "When I come through on the dance floor" interlude.
Cameo appearances are made by Akon and Space Cowboy.
MTV called the video as an ode to the "Me Decade".
During an interview with Australian radio in September 2008, Gaga said that "The whole video is performance art about being drunk at a party."
When asked about the shooting experience of the music video, Gaga explained,
"Oh it was so fun, it was amazing.
For me it was like being on a Martin Scorsese set.
I've been so low budget for so long, and to have this incredibly amazing video was really very humbling.
It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day – I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody.
I'm not like the party girl running around.
I might even seem to be a bit of a diva.
I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement.
I don't just show up for things, you know.
That video was a vision of mine.
It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle.
It was all those things, I love it."
