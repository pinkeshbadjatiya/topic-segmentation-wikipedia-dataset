Kevin "Stonefish" Rebecchi is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera "Neighbours", played by Anthony Engelman.
He made his first appearance on 31 March 1994.
Stonefish was the first of the Rebecchi family to appear and he was later followed by his mother, father and brothers.
The character left in 1996, but returned briefly in 2003.
In 2007, Engelman reprised his character again and Stonefish returned to Ramsay Street.
He departed on 28 August 2007.
Stonefish returned for two episodes from 9 September 2015, and one episode on 4 May 2016.
==========
In 1994, "TV Week" revealed "Neighbours" would be introducing "a younger, livelier look with six regular characters under the age of 18."
Shortly after, the character of Stonefish was created and introduced to the show.
Engelman was cast in the role and he told a writer for "Inside Soap" that his first script said that the character got his nickname because he looked like a stonefish.
The actor quipped "They'd written that before they'd even cast me!
When I got my script I was like 'What the hell does a stonefish look like anyway?!'"
Stonefish became the first member of the Rebecchi family to arrive in Erinsborough.
He was later joined by his mother, father, brother and cousin.
The character left in 1996.
==========
A writer for "Inside Soap" said Stonefish was happiest causing a stir in the classroom, and that wherever there was trouble, you could bet he was involved.
Stonefish arrived in Ramsay Street after believing Brett Stark (Brett Blewitt) had started dating his girlfriend Sassy Patterson-Smythe (Defah Dattner).
Engelman said Stonefish was usually easy going, but he became really jealous.
However, when Sassy moved out of the picture, Stonefish and Brett become great friends.
When Stonefish fell behind with his studies, Cody Willis (Peta Brady) helped him out, making Stonefish think she was romantically interested in him.
Engelman said, "He's really got the hots for her, but when he makes a pass at her at a party it all goes horribly wrong."
The actor said he had a lot in common with his character, as he had a tough time at school too and did not have much luck with girls.
When asked if Stonefish would ever get a girlfriend or roam around Ramsay Street in his stonewash denim forever, Engelman replied "Life gets much better for Stonefish.
There might even be romance on the horizon, but I'm afraid he'll always be a dag."
Stonefish later stole some exam papers from Erinsborough High and he sold them to Rick Alessi (Dan Falzon), who wanted to help Cody when she fell behind with her revision.
When Rick gave Cody the papers, she had second thoughts about cheating.
Stonefish eventually grew up and became a "reformed bully".
He and his family – mother Angie (Lesley Baker), father Kevin (Don Bridges), brothers Shane (Greg O'Meara) and Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) – moved into Number 32 Ramsay Street.
An "Inside Soap" columnist called the Rebecchi family "dodgy" and said the residents should nail down their valuables and lock up their daughters.
Stonefish made a brief return in 2003 for his brother Toadie's wedding to Dee Bliss (Madeleine West).
After Toadie accidentally drove the wedding car off a cliff and into the sea, Stonie helped to save his brother.
In August 2007, Stonefish returned to "Neighbours" to "cause some trouble for little brother Toadie".
Stonie came to stay with Toadie following marital problems.
He was also battling a drug problem and when Toadie learned of this, he threw Stonie out.
But Toadie's girlfriend Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) took pity on Stonie and allowed him to move back in.
Engleman did not hesitate to return to the show upon learning that Stonie would be going through a "rocky time" in his life.
He was pleased to play out such an interesting storyline for his character, saying "In some ways, I felt drama was missing from Stonie's storylines in the past.
He was always just chasing girls or trying to get rich quick."
In August 2015, it was confirmed that Engelman had reprised his role.
The actor told Sarah Ellis of "Inside Soap" that he had thought about returning to the show after watching the "Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite" documentary.
A few days later, his agent contacted him to say that "Neighbours" wanted him back as Stonie for a short stint.
Stonie returned to Erinsborough on 9 September.
He came to visit Toadie, who had recently suffered a fall that left him paralysed and confined to a wheelchair.
Ellis observed, "Stonie's arrival comes just as the right time – and he proves to be exactly the tonic his brother needs."
Lesley Baker (Angie) was pleased to be reunited with Engelman, saying that she wished they could have spent more time together, as he and Moloney are fun to work with.
Engelman also said that if he were to return again, he wanted more focus on getting to know his family, as he believed it would be fun getting the whole clan back together.
The character will return again on 4 May 2016.

It all seems to be going well until Danni reveals the truth to Stonie who turns his anger on Brett.

Annalise confesses all to Sam, who later punches Stonie when he sees him in Annalise's hotel room.

When Stonie and Malcolm buy a car together, they are horrified to learn its previous owners were drug dealers and the stash is still inside.

After smelling smoke again, Frazer looks over the fence and spots Stonie smoking.
After a mishap where Charlie Hoyland accidentally discovers the dope, Stonie then comes clean to Toadie and Charlie's mother, Steph and explains he is depressed because he and Chantelle were trying for a baby and they are not having much luck.
Chantelle comes to Ramsay Street to sort her husband out.
Stonie announces he is giving up marijuana.
However, just as he is about to throw the rest in the bin, he holds onto it.
Chantelle gives him an ultimatum: her or the marijuana.
Stonie chooses her and throws out the marijuana, and they return to Port Keats.
After learning that Toadie has been paralysed in an accident, Stonie returns to Erinsborough to visit him.
He organises a day of pizza and wrestling, but Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) interrupts to invite them to a seminar at the hospital.
