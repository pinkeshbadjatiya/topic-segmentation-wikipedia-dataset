==========
The professional wrestling matches at Extreme Rules featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, WWE.
Storylines between the characters played out on WWE's primary television programs, "Raw" and "SmackDown".
Extreme Rules was originally scheduled for May 1, 2016, at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois.
However, it switched dates and venues with Payback.
On the first post-WrestleMania "Raw" on April 4, AJ Styles won a four-way match for a shot at the WWE World Heavyweight Championship held by Roman Reigns and retained his title opportunity by defeating Sami Zayn on the next "Raw".
On the April 25 episode of "Raw", Styles saved Reigns from an attack by Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows, but Reigns then attacked Styles.
At Payback, Styles faced Reigns for the world title.
Reigns was first counted out and then disqualified, but the match was restarted twice (first by Shane McMahon and then Stephanie McMahon), turning into a no disqualification match.
After interferences by both Anderson and Gallows and the Usos, Reigns eventually pinned Styles to retain the title.
Subsequently, Vince, Shane and Stephanie McMahon agreed that Styles should get a title rematch at Extreme Rules in an Extreme Rules match.
After Styles, Anderson and Gallows beat Reigns and the Usos on the May 2 episode of "Raw", Anderson and Gallows wanted Styles to hit Reigns with a chair but Styles refused.
When the Usos attacked Styles from behind with a chair, Styles retaliated with the chair.
Ultimately, Reigns powerbombed Styles through the broadcast table.
The tag team tournament to determine the #1 contender match for the WWE Tag Team Championship culminated at Payback, in a match pitting The Vaudevillains against Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady, which ended in a no contest after Enzo Amore suffered a legit concussion.
On the following night on "Raw", The Vaudevillains were awarded a title match against WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day at Extreme Rules.
At Payback, WWE Women's Champion Charlotte defeated Natalya in controversial fashion; when Charlotte had her opponent in the Sharpshooter, referee Charles Robinson awarded the match to Charlotte despite Natalya not having submitted, similar to the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series 1997.
On the following night on "Raw", a Submission match between Charlotte and Natalya was scheduled for "Extreme Rules"; Ric Flair was banned from ringside, with the added stipulation any appearance by Flair would result in Charlotte losing the title.
On the May 2 episode of "Raw", Rusev won a battle royal, last eliminating Zack Ryder, to earn a title match against United States Champion Kalisto at Extreme Rules.
At WrestleMania 32, Kevin Owens lost the Intercontinental Championship to Zack Ryder in a seven-man ladder match that also included Sami Zayn and The Miz.
The next night on "Raw", The Miz won the Intercontinental Championship after his wife Maryse distracted Ryder.
On the April 11 episode of "Raw", Owens interrupted Shane McMahon and demanded a title shot, but Shane instead booked him in a #1 contender match against Cesaro, which Cesaro won.
At Payback, Owens defeated Zayn, and then stayed for commentary during the Intercontinental Championship match; Zayn attacked Owens and a fight broke between the two.
While Owens and Zayn were fighting at the ropes, Cesaro tried to throw them, but Miz pinned him to retain the title.
Then Owens, Miz, Cesaro and Zayn began a brawl with Owens standing tall at the end holding the championship.
The next night on "Raw", another #1 contender match between Owens and Cesaro occurred, but the match ended with no contest after Miz, who was on commentary, attacked Cesaro.
Zayn then ran down to the ring and the fight ended with Zayn standing tall holding the championship.
On the May 5 episode of "SmackDown", Miz interrupted Zayn on "The Highlight Reel" and a match was booked later between the two, which Zayn won after Owens interfered.
Cesaro ran down to the ring and a fight between the four ensued, which ended with Cesaro holding the championship.
On the May 9 episode of "Raw", Shane and Stephanie McMahon scheduled a triple threat title match at Extreme Rules between Owens, Miz and Cesaro.
Zayn demanded to be inserted into the match as well, and defeated Miz later in the night to win contendership, thus turning the match into a fatal four way.
At Payback, Dean Ambrose defeated Chris Jericho.
On the next night on "Raw", during a segment of "The Ambrose Asylum" with Stephanie McMahon, Stephanie cancelled "Ambrose Asylum" and reinstated Jericho's talk show, "The Highlight Reel".
Jericho came out and attacked Ambrose.
The following week on "Raw", Ambrose attacked Jericho and destroyed Jericho's jacket.
On the May 12 episode of "SmackDown", Jericho attacked Ambrose and put the straightjacket on Ambrose.
On the May 16 episode of "Raw", Ambrose challenged Jericho to a match at Extreme Rules, which Jericho accepted.
Ambrose then revealed that their match would be a Asylum match, a steel cage match with weapons hanging above the cage.
Baron Corbin's first WWE singles match on the first "Raw" after WrestleMania ended in a double countout against Dolph Ziggler.
Ziggler then defeated Corbin on the Payback pre-show.

Rusev won when Kalisto submitted to the "Accolade" submission hold.
After that, The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods) defeated The Vaudevillains (Aiden English and Simon Gotch) to retain the Tag Team Championship.
The referee missed non-participant Kofi Kingston interfering by executing "Trouble in Paradise" on Gotch, which led to Woods executing a "Shining Wizard" on Gotch for the pinfall.

The match stipulation was that if Ric Flair appeared at ringside, Charlotte would have lost the title.
The end of the match saw Natalya applying the "Sharpshooter", when Ric Flair's music played and a figure resembling Flair appeared in the aisle.
The figure turned out to be Dana Brooke masquerading as Ric Flair.
A distracted Natalya broke the hold and was attacked by Charlotte, who applied a "Figure Eight Leglock" for the win.
==========

In the first half of the match, Styles and Reigns brawled around the arena: Reigns suffered a "Phenomenal Forearm" from the pre-show table, while Styles suffered a back body drop through a broadcast table.
When Styles attacked Reigns's knee mid-way in the match, Reigns sold a knee injury at times, but he was still able to powerbomb Styles through another broadcast table, counter Styles' "Phenomenal Forearm" with a "Superman Punch", and finally spear Styles at ringside.

Critics gave a mixed-to-positive reception to the show, generally praising firstly the Intercontinental Championship four-way and secondly the main event WWE World Heavyweight Championship match and its post-match happenings, but the rest of the show was not as well received.
The high amount of punishment AJ Styles received during the main event was also highlighted.
James Caldwell of "Pro Wrestling Torch" said that it was "unfortunate there were so many finisher kick-outs on this show, but that seems to be the trend these days".
Caldwell rated the four-way match the best of the show at 4.5 stars out of 5, commenting that "strong build-up" resulted in a "strong title match", with further positives including that the "Owens-Zayn feud was enhanced, Cesaro's amazing in-ring skills were captured, and Miz's post-Mania resurgence continued".
The next-best rated match was the main event at 3.75 stars: a "very physical, PPV main event-worthy battle continuing to build up Styles's strong first year in WWE.
Reigns plays the part well of a PPV main-eventer when matched up with the right opponent, like Styles, but not someone like Sheamus."
Also, Styles took a "crazy amount of punishment" during the match.
The rest of the matches of the event were less well received, being rated either 2.25 or 2.5 stars.
Corbin's pre-show performance showed he had "a lot of work to do to belong" on the main roster; the Tornado tag match was rushed and "disorganized"; Rusev winning the U.S. Championship was a positive; the tag title match was mostly a "basic TV-quality action" except for a "good nearfall for The Vaudevillains"; while the Asylum match had a "good" finish, but was dragged down by "an overly-gimmicky WWE cage match concept" and the "middle portion [being] a big struggle trying to follow the four-way".
Jack de Menezes of "The Independent" praised the Intercontinental title match, the main event and Seth Rollins' return, but "elsewhere there was little to shout about, with matches either ending too short or lacking the thrills that ended the night".
The review deemd the four-way as "one of the matches of the year" that highlighted the Miz as an "crafty champion" with "all his underhand tactics" en route to retaining the title, as well as the "hatred that remains between Zayn and Owens".
The main event was deemed "brilliant" and an "epic battle", leading to the show ending with Rollins' "long-awaited return" as the crowd erupted into cheers - this was contrasted with Reigns' "frosty reception".
The Asylum "match slowed down too often whenever either man tried to get a new weapon", with de Menezes hoping Jericho and Ambrose's "drawn out rivalry" ended at Extreme Rules.
For the tag title match, the Vaudevillains "put in their best performance to date since moving up to the main roster".
Finally, Rusev, Anderson and Gallows dominated their respective matches, while Baron Corbin provided "a show of brute strength and craftiness".
Dave Meltzer of the "Wrestling Observer" wrote that the Intercontinental title match "tore down the house" as a "super match with tons of near falls and saves", and "Cesaro and Zayn in particular were great."
The main event was "another super match", as "Styles had a death wish taking some crazy and I mean crazy bumps including a high backdrop through a table where he landed on his tailbone".
Then, the "crowd went totally nuts for [Rollins] as a babyface" in the post-match segment.
Kalisto-Rusev was "good", with WWE "pushing like Kalisto was injured at the end, and was coming into the match injured".
The women's match was poorer than Payback's and meant to "elevate Dana Brooke", with Meltzer feeling that the long-term plan is "putting Charlotte and Dana Brooke into a duo to eventually set them up as rivals".
The tag matches were both "short", the first match seeing the crowd support going to Anderson and Gallows instead of the Usos.
The short matches led to a "weird match" that was "just too long" between Ambrose and Jericho.
The Asylum match "didn't have much heat for a long time" and was "hurt following such a great" four-way.
However, Ambrose and Jericho did "pick it up at the end", with Jericho "selling [the thumbtacks] tremendously" for the finish.
Kenny Herzog of "Rolling Stone" criticized Extreme Rules as most of its match "outcomes were far from shocking"; also, it had a "dated" title and for "its namesake stipulation" failed to "really lord its influence over the card".
Herzog highlighted the Asylum match as a "prop-comedy disaster" that was "unsurprisingly, utterly inane", but it was "Jericho, tacks and all, who rescued this clunker from meaninglessness by giving it his unquestioned all".
Meanwhile, Herzog could not understand "WWE's insistence on shading Ambrose as more goofy than gritty".
Another disappointment was the women's match for having a "bizarre, forced finish", as Brooke's "arbitrary shift in allegiances rings pretty hollow".
Herzog also hoped that Natalya would not fade into "irrelevance after helping carry the post-WrestleMania malaise".
Meanwhile, the finish of the tag title match was "a bit cockamamie, and the opening tornado-rules contest was ho-hum".
Herzog still found positives in the show: the four-way was "perfect" with a "multitude of near-falls and clever finish" while everyone gave their "best".
Also, AJ Styles, "more than any other latter-career migrant to Vince McMahon's big top, has expeditiously qualified himself as a main-eventer", having displayed "world-class" skills in the ring and taken "some Hall of Fame bumps".
Then, the "rousing return" at the end of the show resulted in "the torch of Heavyweight was cannily passed from super-sub A.J.
to present- and future-stud Seth Rollins".
