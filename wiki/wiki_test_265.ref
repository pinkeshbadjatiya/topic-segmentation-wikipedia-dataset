Talgai Homestead
Talgai Homestead is a heritage-listed homestead at Allora, Southern Downs Region, Queensland, Australia.
It was designed by architect Richard George Suter for Queensland pastoralist and politician George Clark and was built in 1868.
It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992.
It is also known as East Talgai Homestead to distinguish it from the West Talgai Homestead built by George's brother Charles Clark.
==========
Talgai Homestead was built in 1868 for George Edwin Clark, then owner of that part of the old Talgai run which lies east of the present Toowoomba-Warwick rail line and was designed by prominent Queensland architect Richard George Suter.
This substantial sandstone homestead was first known as "East Talgai" the second of three "Talgais" to be constructed on what was part of the original "Talgai" run taken up by Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple in 1840.
Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple was part of the first wave of European settlers, who included Patrick and George Leslie, and George and John Gammie, to drive stock to the newfound Darling Downs area on receiving instructions from explorer Allan Cunningham who first recognised the potential of the area for pastoral settlement in 1827.
These early squatters overlanded their stock through the New England district from Sydney as access to the Darling Downs through the penal settlement of Moreton Bay was not allowed, nor was any settlement within 50 miles of the penal colony permitted.
This group of pastoralists were instrumental in settling the land which in subsequent decades was to become Queensland's prime pastoral and agricultural district and which also became a seat of political power in 19th century Queensland.
Dalrymple only held the Talgai run until his death in 1844 after which Talgai passed through several owners, possibly being owned by the Gammie brothers at one point.
In 1862, the property was divided, with the southern portion becoming "North Toolburra" and Clark and Hamner acquiring the portion known as Old Talgai where they ran a high-grade wool merino stud.
This partnership was later broken and the property remained in Hamner's possession until his death, when it passed to the Queensland Cattle Company, and later to Lucht, who sold it to George and Charles Clark in 1865.
The Clark brothers divided the land again, George taking East Talgai and Charles taking the western portion, on which the Old Talgai homestead had stood.
In 1874 Charles Clark constructed his own home, Ellinthorpe Hall (the third Talgai) on this western portion of the run and this homestead later became known as "West Talgai".
Charles Clark left Talgai in 1890, the western portion of the land eventually being subdivided for closer settlement with the homestead falling into decay and the sandstone blocks from the ruins of the homestead being used to construct a modern home at Flagstone Creek.
When George Clark secured the eastern portion of the Talgai run in 1865 the only structure on the land was an old shepherd's hut.
It was under George Clark's direction that the grand East Talgai Homestead and its many outbuildings were erected.
The stone building situated near the entrance to Talgai was apparently built as a residence for the architect, Richard George Suter and his wife, during the construction of the homestead and the property's huge woolshed.
This building later became a storehouse and residence for the station storekeeper.
Richard George Suter (1827 - 1894) trained as an architect in London under his father after completing a Bachelor of Arts at Trinity College at Cambridge in 1850.
By 1865 Suter was working for Brisbane's leading architect Benjamin Backhouse while establishing his own practice.
Suter was one of Queensland's most prolific and prominent architects of the late 19th century and was responsible for such grand designs as Jimbour House (Suter & Voysey 1873), St Mark's Church, Warwick (1867â€“70) and is recognised for his influence on the standard designs of schools in Queensland with the Board of Education using his designs almost exclusively until 1875.
After a decline in his success, Suter moved to Melbourne in 1876 and became a priest for the Catholic Apostolic Church, where he died of heart disease in 1894.
Talgai Homestead was built of sandstone and covered sixty squares.
The original roof was of shingles and the verandahs of hand and pit-sawn spotted gum, with cedar doors and architraves.
Unlike the usual design for that period, the kitchen was attached to the main house.
George and Ellen Clark lived an affluent life at the grand East Talgai.
The homestead was richly furnished and featured antique pieces which were probably a part of Ellen's dowry.
George Clark was active in local affairs and Queensland politics, sitting on the Warwick Bench of Magistrates, holding an official position on the St. Marks Church Committee as well as the Warwick School of Arts, the Warwick Hospital Committee and the Royal Agricultural Society.
He also had a short- lived but very controversial period as a member of Queensland Parliament.
During this time, he set up the "Warwick Examiner and Times" newspaper which was a pro-squatter vehicle and was constantly engaged in editorial clashes with the "Warwick Argus" established by James Morgan, the former Talgai manager and a staunch anti-squatter advocate.
George Clark was involved in accusations of collusion with the Survey Office in 1871, allegedly using his position to avoid the restrictions of the Land Act 1868 to acquire additional land for his East Talgai run.
During the 1860s and 1870s Talgai was becoming what was arguably the most successful sheep stud in Queensland producing immense amounts of quality merino wool and trading in high quality rams which were exported to Tasmania and Germany.
Talgai peaked in its production during the 1880s when stock figures reached 20 000 sheep and 3000 Devon cattle.
Talgai Station was a fully developed self-contained estate village during the 1880s.
It incorporated employee's cottages, a smithy, stables, barn, woolshed, slaughterhouse, dairy and school.
Beside the Olive tree, which still remains today near the back gate of the property, George also constructed a stone chapel which was used for family worship but was never consecrated.
This chapel was pulled down in 1942 as, according to George's son, George Carr Clark's will, the sandstone was to be used to construct a tower for St Marks Church, Warwick, however this never came to pass.
Talgai had three different watering systems which serviced the crops, the kitchen garden and formal English garden.
Talgai also had vines of table grapes and an orchard of stone fruit.
It was in 1886 when a major anthropological discovery was made at Talgai.
William Naish, fencing contractor, inadvertently discovered a skull where heavy rain had scoured out a creek bed.
It was not until 1914 that Professor Edgeworth David, Professor of Archaeology at Sydney University on paying a visit to Talgai, presented a theory that the skull was 20,000 years old and provided a "missing link" in the evolutionary chain.
Interest in the skull and the site at which it was found persisted until the 1960s, during which time the CSIRO and the Queensland Museum had conducted archaeological surveys at the site.
Interest in the skull waned in the following decades as newer theories eclipsed those attached to the Talgai Skull.
The original skull is housed at the Sydney Museum.
George Clark died in 1907 and the property passed to his son George Carr Clark at which time he sold-off 5000 acres of Talgai and purchased "Yanna" station on the Warrego River.
About 2000 special stud ewes remained at Talgai and the stud sires were bred there and transferred to Yanna for fattening.
Aberdeen Angus stud cattle were introduced to Talgai in 1916 and ultimately became the main business of Talgai.
In 1934 both the cattle and the sheep studs were sold at public auction, leaving about 750 acres on the homestead block around East Talgai house.
George Carr Clark resided there with his wife and various family members until his death in 1942 when the entire property was sold.
In 1968 Talgai was acquired by Mr and Mrs D Panton who undertook extensive restoration work.
Talgai Homestead operated as a function and luxury accommodation centre but has since become a private residence.
