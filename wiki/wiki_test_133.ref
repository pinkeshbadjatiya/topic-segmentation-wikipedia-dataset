Knickerbocker Greys
The Knickerbocker Greys is the oldest after school activity in the United States, founded in 1881 for children aged 6 to 16.
Since its founding, the primary purpose of the Greys “is to instill in cadets a sense of personal responsibility, and instinct for leadership, the habit of reliability, and the self-assurance which follows mastery of these steps to useful citizenship.” Cadets undergo a series of experiences over the years that build confidence, improve self-esteem, develop character, social skills, patience, perseverance, enthusiasm, public speaking, problem solving and leadership.
The tradition of the Knickerbocker Greys lives on in all of the cadets.
==========
The Knickerbocker Greys was founded by Mrs. Augusta Lawler Stacey Curtis, the wife of Dr. Edward Curtis, a noted New York physician who served on the staff of the Surgeon General of the Union Army, and assisted in the autopsy on the body of President Abraham Lincoln.
She started the corps as a way to keep her boys out of trouble, since they had taken to hanging out at candy stores after school.
At the time, there were no after school activities or organized sports.
With a group of mothers, Mrs. Curtis asked Lieutenant Adolph W. Callison of the 22nd Regiment to be a Drill Master, and found a location at the 12th Regiment New York National Guard Armory.
They chose a uniform similar to that of an English organization, consisting of a gray jacket, knickerbockers, and round cap, which were all trimmed with black braid.
The group’s name was derived from the original uniform’s knee-length pants that were known as "knickerbockers”, and the color of the dress uniform, “Cadet Grey”.
This color is still used on West Point Cadet Uniforms.
In the winter 1886-1887 the 12th Regiment moved into their new armory, so the Greys obtained permission to drill in the armory of the 71st Regiment then at Broadway and 35th Street.
They followed the Regiment first to Broadway and 45th Street and later to their armory at Park Avenue and 34th Street.
During the construction of this armory on Park Avenue, the Greys used various halls about the city for one season.
In 1902 the 71st Regiment Armory burned down and the Knickerbocker Greys were invited to drill in the 7th Regiment Armory (now known as the Park Avenue Armory) at Park Avenue and East 67th Street through the courtesy of Colonel Daniel Appleton.

Over 4,500 New Yorkers have been members of the Knickerbocker Grey Cadet Corps over the past 125 years and have recruited cadets from many New York families, some from its highest social ranks.
Many prominent families enlisted their sons into the Greys, who at the time drilled two afternoons a week.
John D Rockefeller III and Nelson Rockefeller were both Greys, as well as Cornelius Vanderbilt III, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and John Lindsay.
Along with such famous cadets, many other children have been Greys, from public, parochial, private, and even home schools.
Originally an all male organization, the Greys became coed in 1986.
There have been three female cadet colonels, the highest rank any cadet can receive in the organization, since 1986.
The Knickerbocker Greys have been featured in "New York Magazine", "Town And Country", "The New York Times" and most recently "The Wall Street Journal".
