==========
Before debuting with SS501, most members had experiences in the entertainment world.
Kim Hyun-joong was initially about to debut in a five-member group, of which Han Yeon of B2Y (now disbanded) was to be the leader and Kim the youngest member.
During 2001 and 2002, while working as a waiter in a family restaurant located at Jamsil-dong, Kim was introduced to a new set up management company CEO.
While the group underwent training together, they were asked by their company to debut in China as a Hallyu project group, but they rejected the offer and disbanded.
Heo Young-saeng started as a trainee at SM Entertainment for about 2.5 years.
He then joined DSP Media, formerly known as DSP Entertainment and trained for 3 months before debuting as a member of SS501.
In relation with him being a SM trainee, according to his father if he stayed with SM Ent most probably he will debut together with Super Junior.
Park Jung-min was once a commercial model for condoms.
When he was 13, he was scouted by an agency and was accepted by both DSP Media and S.M.
Entertainment.
At that time, S.M.
Entertainment told him that they were preparing a new group, but that the group consisted of many members, which according to Park was probably Super Junior since he saw them rehearsing too.
Kim Hyung-jun appeared on Ock Joo-hyun's music video, "Catch" in 2004.
He was also the first one to be included in SS501, which means he had the longest training period.
In addition, SS501 has had their first variety show before they officially debuted entitled "SS501 M!Pick" by MNET, documenting their pre-debut days and three months after their debut.
==========

During this time, they also established their official fan club name, "Triple S", and fan club color, pearl green.
The group earned popularity right away as they won many rookie awards after their debut.
The group was inactive in Korea for most of 2006, although they had their first fan meeting in Japan in April of that year.
The reason was due to Heo Young Saeng's throat condition, which required a surgery, thus resulting in a need for time to fully recover.
In mid-2006, they held their first successful concert, "Step Up Concert" in Osaka, Japan.
In late 2006, they returned to Korea in order to promote their first studio album, which was released on November 10 entitled "S.T 01 Now".
Singles from the album included "Unlock" and "Four Chance".
Alongside promoting the album on various variety and music shows, they also filmed a show on MNet, which was called "SS501 SOS".
The group (excepting Heo Young Saeng, who was recovering from the surgery) also lent their voices for the 2006 animated movie "Pi's Story".

Later in 2007, the group debuted in the Japanese market to further spread their activities and challenge themselves outside Korea.
A Japanese fan club was established with the name "Triple S Japan", which officially debuted on March 25, 2007, when SS501 had their first official meeting with the club.

The single debuted at the 5th spot on the Oricon chart, and moved to 3rd spot the next day.
It was also chosen as an ending theme song for an anime entitled "Blue Dragon".

During this time, around early 2009, Park Jung-min was also cast for his musical debut in "Grease" as "Danny Park", where he received the award "Best New Musical Talent" by the "Golden Ticket Awards".
While both Kim and Park were busy with their schedules, the remaining three members formed 'SS501 Project Group' with Heo Young-saeng as the leader.
The 'Project Group' was initially to be named after their fan club 'Triple S', however before the sub-unit group debut it was decided to retain 'SS501' name out of respect to the absent members.
They released a project album named "U R Man" in November 2008, with a high tempo dance track "U R Man", which the three remaining SS501 members promoted by themselves, with the exception of some special performances that included all five band members.
The project group also performed "U R Man" in episode four of "Boys Over Flowers", where they appeared for a cameo performance.
Moreover, they contributed to the "Boys Over Flowers" soundtrack with "내 머리가 나빠서" (Because I'm Stupid) track, in which they received multiple awards such as "Song of the Month (February)", "Best OST Award", and "Best TV Drama Song of the Year" just to name a few.
