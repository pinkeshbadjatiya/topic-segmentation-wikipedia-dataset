Ozzy Lusth
Oscar "Ozzy" Lusth (born August 23, 1981 in Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico) is an American reality show contestant who first appeared on "".
He finished as the runner-up to Yul Kwon.
Lusth later competed in "" as one of the returning favorites and then competed on the show for a third time in "".
He also appeared on the second "American Ninja Warrior" where he was eliminated on the obstacle, the Bridge of Blades.
==========
On "", Lusth was originally a member of the Aitutaki (Aitu) tribe, which represented Latinos.
Having no particular alliance with any members, he was seen as a threat with unbeatable survival skills.
In , he suggested the tribe throw the immunity challenge so they could vote out the weak link, Billy Garcia.
Lusth's plan was met with skepticism, particularly with Cristina Coria.
However, the vote went his way and Garcia was voted out at Tribal Council.
Following the merge, Lusth remained in Aitu with only one of his original tribemates, Cecelia Mansilla.
Lusth was perceived a threat due to his outstanding physical strength, and he led his tribes to numerous immunities.
Yet, he remained on the outs, not part of the dominating alliance of Yul Kwon, Candice Woodcock, Becky Lee, and Jonathan Penner, and Lusth lost his original tribemate, Mansilla.
Following the third tribal council, Lusth was angry that his tribe had voted for Mansilla, but was comforted by his tribemates.
After two straight wins, Jeff announced both tribes were going to Tribal Council.
Lusth, along with the rest of the tribe except Jessica "Flica" Smith, denounced "Plan Voodoo" and voted out Cao Boi Bui.
The tribe lost immunity at the next challenge and Smith was unanimously voted out.
Lusth played a large part in the next three straight wins and the Rarotonga (Raro) tribe saw their numbers were dwindling.
However, when Probst announced an offer of mutiny, the Aitu tribe was left shocked and decimated as original Raro members Woodcock and Penner jumped back, thus making Raro eight members strong.
The challenge following the mutiny was dominated by the Aitu Four (Sundra Oakley, Lusth, Kwon, and Lee) and Lusth infamously stated "Mutineers are the first people to die."
He and the Aitu Four kept good on the promise sending Woodcock to Exile Island multiple times and eventually sealing the fate of both her and Penner.
The mutiny sealed Lusth in his alliance with Oakley, Kwon, and Lee, and the Aitu Four dominated subsequent challenges.
Following the tribal merge, Lusth remained loyal to the Aitu Four and voted with his allies to send Nate Gonzalez, Woodcock, Penner, Parvati Shallow, and Adam Gentry off, despite there being times where he considered aligning with Shallow.
Lusth was seen as a threat by allies Lee and Oakley, who went to Kwon in an attempt to vote Lusth out.
Yet, Lusth won immunity once again, forcing execution of the original plan of voting out former Raro members.
Lusth won the final immunity challenge and scored himself a spot in the Final Three, along with Kwon, who had the hidden immunity idol.
Forced to vote one of their own out, Lee and Oakley ended up tied at two votes against each of them.
Lee won the fire-making tiebreaker, securing herself a spot with Kwon and Lusth.
At the final Tribal Council, Lusth was praised for his athletic skills, yet criticized for being somewhat of a loner.
He finished in second place in a 5–4–0 vote, and was the first male runner-up in two years since the eighth season.
Probst also stated at the reunion show that he had dominated physically like no one ever had.
Prior to the million dollar vote, Gentry had promised that he would give Kwon his vote if he was kept longer than Penner.
Kwon made sure this would happen, and Gentry stayed true to his promise.
Lusth gained the votes of Raro members Shallow, Gonzalez, Jenny Guzon-Bae and Rebecca Borman.
He was the longest-lasting contestant from the original Aitu tribe, and stayed an Aitu member even after the tribe switch.
Dominant in swimming, agility and balance, he won five out of six individual immunity challenges.
He won a Mercury Mariner, being voted favorite player of the season.
With his five immunity challenge wins in "Cook Islands", Lusth tied with Colby Donaldson, Tom Westman, and Terry Deitz for the record of the most immunity challenge wins in a single season.
Since then, that feat has also been matched by Mike Holloway.

"" was Lusth's second appearance on Survivor.
With regard to his prior appearance, Lusth commented, "My mistakes last time were basically being too much of a loner.
I'm never going to go anywhere by myself except to use the bathroom".
Originally part of the Malakal tribe representing the Favorites, Lusth decided to establish alliances.
He allied himself with Amanda Kimmel, a "" contestant.
The two went on to join forces with James Clement, Kimmel's ally from "China", and Parvati Shallow, Lusth's fellow contestant on "Cook Islands".
The four became known for the romantic relationships between Lusth and Kimmel and between Clement and Shallow, with Cirie Fields joking that Kimmel would be giving birth to "little Ozzlets."
The tribe faced an early defeat and the alliance of four found themselves against another dominating alliance of Ami Cusack, Jonathan Penner, Eliza Orlins and Yau-Man Chan.
Both alliances attempted to recruit Jonny Fairplay, whose vote would become the swing vote.
However, things changed with Fairplay asked to be sent home to be with his pregnant girlfriend, and the tribe honored his wish and voted him out 9-1, with Fairplay voting for Lusth.
Faced with a loss in , the four recruited Fields as their fifth member and voted out Chan, who was perceived as a threat by her.
In , Lusth was banished to Exile Island where he found the immunity idol and put a fake one in the place where he found the real one.
Following a tribal switch in , he remained with two of his alliance members, Kimmel and Fields.
The tribe began to lose in immunity challenges and subsequently voted off the Fans: Joel Anderson, Chet Welch, and Tracy Hughes-Wolf; during this time, Penner, now a member of Airai, was evacuated and Kathy Sleckman quit.
With the tribe numbers becoming even, Malakal lost the challenge before the merge and voted off Cusack.
When Lusth reunited with his alliance at the merge, the five of them took control of the game, voting off Orlins, whom Shallow disliked.
He became comfortable with his position in the game, trusting Kimmel, Clement, and Shallow completely.
He also found an ally in Fan Erik Reichenbach, who admired Lusth's abilities.
However, Shallow had plans of her own.
Having aligned herself with Fans Natalie Bolton and Alexis Jones while on Airai, she found herself in trouble when Fields approached her with a plan to blindside Lusth.
Shallow's vote became the swing vote and she was confused, debating whether or not to vote her ally out.
But Shallow stuck with Fields and convinced Lusth to leave his idol back at camp.
At tribal council, Lusth was blindsided and this became the start of the women's alliance's domination, led by Shallow.
At the final tribal council he berated Shallow for selling away their friendship and refused to let her talk.
He also confessed his love for Kimmel, whom he cast his vote for saying she deserved the money a million times more than Shallow.
He and Kimmel were still together as of the reunion show, but he revealed in an interview that they had separated before he returned for Season 23, "".
He also revealed at the reunion show that he and Shallow have healed their friendship.

Lusth returned, along with Benjamin "Coach" Wade, for a third shot at the game in "".
He revealed that he wanted to play a strategic game this time, feeling that everyone only saw him as a physical threat in previous games.
He was randomly assigned to the Savaii tribe, where he quickly formed a core alliance with Keith Tollefson and Jim Rice, with Whitney Duncan and Elyse Umemoto being the extra members.
His increasing closeness with Umemoto prompted Rice to undercut his power in by convincing the tribe to vote out Umemoto instead of John Cochran.
This initially angered Lusth, but he later forgave his tribe.
As the tribe approached what they suspected was the last Tribal Council before the merge and the return of the Redemption Island victor, Lusth made an unprecedented, bold, and strategic move by requesting that his tribe vote him out to Redemption Island, in the hope that he would beat long-running Redemption Island resident Christine Shields-Markoski and return to the merged tribe, making the former Savaii numbers equal to the former Upolu members.
Jeff Probst has called this one of the greatest moves in "Survivor" history.
The plan worked, but at the first post-merge Tribal Council Cochran betrayed his own tribe and joined with Upolu in voting out Tollefson, followed by Lusth and his other former tribemates, one by one.
Back on Redemption Island, Lusth defeated Tollefson, Rice, Dawn Meehan, Duncan, Cochran, Edna Ma, and Brandon Hantz to stay in the game.
Ozzy won immunity when he got back into the game and Rick Nelson was voted off.
However, in the next challenge Lusth was defeated by Sophie Clarke at a puzzle game and became the last person voted off to become the final member of the jury.
He later cast his vote for Clarke to win.
He did, however, win the $100,000 Sprint Player of the Season prize over Cochran who came in a distant second.
Lusth was also the last member of the original Savaii tribe and set a "Survivor" record in being voted out three times in one season.
