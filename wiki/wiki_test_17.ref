McMullen was cast in the role after having previously auditioned for a smaller role but after impressing producer he was asked to play the regular role of Finn.
Finn is described as having a "childlike naively optimistic view of life" and as someone who "talks a lot and often uses this to try and talk himself out of difficult or awkward situations".
Finn has the power of telekinesis, "but he doesn’t really know how to use it".
Writing for "The Independent", Neela Debanth said she finds Jess more likeable than Finn although "there is more to Finn on closer inspection".
Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy said that McMullen "makes a strong first impression" while Jordan Farley of "SFX" said Finn has his "moments to shine" but that he ultimately "fails to make a big impression".

A casting call for Finn described him as having a "childlike naively optimistic view of life, he’s always eager to please and enthusiastic about life.
Finn talks a lot and often uses this to try and talk himself out of difficult or awkward situations.
He is very funny".
Finn has the power of telekinesis, "but not in an A-list kind of way".
McMullen described the character, saying: "He’s quite naive, but he’s eager to please.
He wants to be your friend, but he tries too hard, and I think that relates to his power.
He’s telekinetic, but he doesn’t really know how to use it.
He’ll sit at home for two hours a night attempting to use this power and move a pencil an inch.
As a person he’ll hopefully realise he doesn’t need to try as hard to please people and likewise, with his power, he doesn’t need to try as hard to use it, otherwise it won’t work properly".
Producer Matt Strevens told a reporter at "SFX" that Finn "has a dark secret that is revealed" and "what we find out is that his secret informs who he is".
Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy called the character a "cheeky, baby-faced Liverpudlian".
SFX's Jordan Farley described Finn using the tagline "Lovable.
Liverpudlian.
Loser", while Claire Webb of "Radio Times" described him as "motor-mouthed Finn".
