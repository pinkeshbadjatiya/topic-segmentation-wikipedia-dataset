Barnevelder
The Barnevelder is a medium heavy breed of chicken named after the Dutch town of Barneveld.
It is a cross of 19th century Dutch landrace chickens with Asian breeds imported to Europe in the mid-late 19th century such as the Brahma, Cochin, Croad Langshan and Malay.
==========
Hans Schippers, the Dutch authority on the breed, reports the following on the development of the Barnevelders: Between c. 1850 and 1875 Cochin, Malay, Brahma and Croad Langshan arrived from Asia and were crossed with local fowl.
One particular strain of brown egg laying fowl were like Black Cochins in appearance and were kept as a meat bird (these were not, however, purebred Cochins).
Around 1885 these birds were crossed with Brahmas and the offspring of this cross was crossed with Langshan.
In 1898 American utility birds ("Amerikaanse Nuthoenders"), a rough version of the Golden Wyandotte (apparently not dissimilar to the American Winnebago, a ‘precursor’ to the Golden-laced Wyandotte) were crossed into the developing breed followed in 1906 by Buff Orpingtons.
Overall in the development to follow the Croad Langshan continued to have the biggest influence and contributed hardiness, brown eggs and good winter production.
A similar account, bar the influence of the "Amerikaanse Nuthoenders", was given in 1930 by P. L. Wijk, District State Poultry Expert, Apeldoorn and P. Ubbels, State Poultry Consultant, Beekbergen, The Netherlands in his contribution on "The Origin of the Barnevelder and Welsummer Breeds".
The authors add that "[i]n 1899 it was ascertained that the fowls on the farms in the neighbourhood of Barneveld showed some uniformity.
This could be explained by the fact that poultry keepers always obtained their setting eggs from the farmers who came to market with the finest eggs, and who as a rule used dark-coloured cocks for breeding."
According to Wijk & Ubbels, efforts were made to obtain more uniformity in colour and type from 1910 onwards and the name Barnevelder dates from that time.
An Association of Barneveld Breeders was established in 1921 which fixed the standard.
Indian Game (Cornish) may have been crossed into the Barnevelders in Britain sometime after their importation into Britain in the 1920s.
The breed gained worldwide recognition and was exported to many countries because of its ability to lay approximately 180-200 large brown eggs per year.
==========
Today, Barnevelders are bred both as a utility breed and a show breed.
They are medium heavy dual-purpose chickens laying a good number of eggs but also yielding a reasonable carcass.
They are hardy birds and good foragers.
While they became famous for their dark brown eggs in the first half of the 20th century most birds now appear to be in the hands of show breeders and not much attention has been given to maintaining the dark brown egg colour or to productivity with the focus being on external characteristics instead.
Many flocks now lay eggs of a much lighter brown than before and are sometimes not quite as productive as befits their reputation.
They are good winter layers and have a quiet disposition.
==========
The original and most well known Barnevelder is the double laced variety with a single vertical comb and yellow legs, but white, black, brown, partridge, blue and double laced blue varieties also exist.
Not all countries recognize all these varieties in their Poultry Standards.
There are large fowl as well as bantam versions of most of the different colours.

Recognized in 1987 in Germany.
Bred from Bantam Black Barnevelders, Bantam Rhode Island Reds and Bantam New Hampshires in Germany.
Partridge (large fowl)
Partridge Barnevelders were still kept in Britain in the 1990s, possibly still derived from early imports.
