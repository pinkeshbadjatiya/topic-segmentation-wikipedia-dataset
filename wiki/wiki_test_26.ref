N. Crevedia
N. Crevedia (born Niculae Ion Cârstea; December 7, 1902 – November 5, 1978) was a Romanian journalist, poet and novelist, father of the writer-politician Eugen Barbu.
Of Muntenian peasant roots, which shaped his commitment to agrarian and then far-right politics, as well as his dialectal poetry and humorous prose, he preferred bohemian life to an academic career.
As a writer at "Gândirea", Crevedia became a follower of Nichifor Crainic, and worked with him on various other press venues, from "Calendarul" to "Sfarmă-Piatră".
Turning to fascism, he sympathized with the Iron Guard, and, in the late 1930s, contributed to the press campaigns vilifying ideological enemies, while also putting out novels, reportage pieces, and anthologies.
His affair with the Iron Guard muse Marta Rădulescu was at the center of a literary scandal, and was fictionalized by Crevedia in one of his novels.
Fluent in Bulgarian, Crevedia became press attaché in the Kingdom of Bulgaria under the National Legionary State, serving to 1946.
He was sidelined by the Romanian communist regime in the late 1940s and early '50s, when he was employed as a minor clerk.
With his mentor Crainic, Crevedia contributed to the propaganda review "Glasul Patriei".
He was more fully recovered under national communism in the 1960s, and lived to see the communist ascendancy of his son Barbu.
His rural-themed poetry, much of it echoing Tudor Arghezi, Ion Minulescu and Sergei Yesenin, was reprinted in various installments to 1977.
It is regarded by critics as a minor but picturesque contribution to modern Romanian literature.
==========
The future writer was born in the eponymous Crevedia Mare, Vlașca County (now Giurgiu County), on .
His parents were the peasants Ion Cârstea and his wife Floarea "née" Antonescu, described the poet as: "well-to-do people of the plow.
I am the first one in my family to have worn a necktie."
Crevedia also saw himself as "purely Romanian and from a fully Romanian region", but was rumored to be of Bulgarian ethnicity.
His birth name was Niculae (or Nicolae) Ion Cârstea, although he later had it officially changed to N. Crevedia, his pseudonym of choice.
One of two sons born to the Cârsteas, he sponsored his younger brother complete a high school education, while his older sisters (one of whom had 17 children of her own) remained largely illiterate.
After completing primary school in his native village, his high school education was interrupted by World War I. Niculae was mobilized as a telephone operator at the mayor's office in Crevedia Mare.
Notoriously philandering into his old age, Crevedia boasted that his first sexual encounters were war widows.
Upon the end of war, he walked to Bucharest, the national capital, in order to complete his education.
In 1923–1924, he was a clerk at the War Ministry, making his published debut in 1924, in the journal "Cultul Eroilor Noștri".
Crevedia graduated from Saint Sava High School in 1925, and then pursued a degree in Slavic studies at the University of Bucharest.
Although he learned Latin and the rudiments of Bulgarian, he never in fact took his degree.
He belonged to the sociological research teams led by Dimitrie Gusti and worked for a while as a substitute teacher, then as a private tutor.
Moving between rented apartments, Crevedia had a sexual relationship with one of his landladies, resulting in the birth of son, the future novelist Eugen Barbu.
According to eyewitnesses, father and son resembled each other perfectly.
Crevedia recognized him as his own, but preferred to be discreet about his existence.
Formally registered as the son of State Railways carpenter Nicolae Barbu, Eugen himself publicly denied his origins, but later admitted to them in private.
Complaining that teaching and studying made him a "misfit", Crevedia took up professional journalism, writing for "Curentul", "Epoca" and "Mișcarea"; other magazines that ran his work include "Rampa", "Vremea", "Adevărul Literar și Artistic", "Bilete de Papagal", "Azi" and "Revista Fundațiilor Regale".
In 1930, "Universul"s literary supplement hosted his interview with writer Vasile Voiculescu, in which the latter spoke about his mystical experiences.
Crevedia's first book, "Epigrame" ("Epigrams"), was published in 1930, followed in 1933 by poetry collection "Bulgări și stele" ("Clumps and Stars").
After frequenting the modernist club at "Sburătorul", he became one of the most dedicated followers of the poet-theologian Nichifor Crainic, and "one of the most constant" contributors to his magazine, "Gândirea".
Crevedia saw himself as "a man of the right, like my father before me".
In his definition, this meant both "ardent" Romanian nationalism and calls for "social justice", with particular emphasis on "the peasant issue": "The [peasantry] is rotten with illness, still ignorant, morally ruined, and political parties have turned it into bedlam."
Drifting toward Crainic's neo-traditionalist and Romanian Orthodox far-right, he served as editor-in-chief for the dailies "Calendarul" and "Porunca Vremii".
He also published in "Cuvântul" reportage pieces which documented the effects of the Great Depression on the Bucharest proletariat.
He followed up with humorous, satirical prose volumes: "Bacalaureatul lui Puiu" ("Puiu's Baccalaureate", 1933), "Dragoste cu termen redus" ("Short-term Love", 1934); together with Al.
С. Calotescu-Neicu, he published "Antologia epigramei românești" ("An Anthology of Romanian Epigrams", 1933).
He won the Romanian Writers' Society prize in 1934 and enjoyed commercial success, but was soon after accused of plagiarism by his "Calendarul" colleague Pan M. Vizirescu and by the epigrammatist Paul I. Papadopol.
==========
This period also brought him and Crainic into contact with the radically antisemitic Iron Guard.
In December 1933, Crevedia was one of the intellectuals who protested in "Axa" magazine against the government's decision to ban the Guard.
During 1935, he was present at Maglavit, one of several Guard sympathizers claiming to have witnessed the religious miracles performed by shepherd Petrache Lupu.
In "Porunca Vremii", he claimed that Lupu had cured his own uncontrollable blinking.
He penned panegyrics to the Guard's Captain Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, an "extraordinary organizer" and "profound thinker who reflects on the current issues facing our nation."
In his words, Codreanu, an example of "virility, faith, and sacrifice, [had] managed to make us believe that this Nation has not disappeared."
He alternated this cult with that of King Carol II and his "Prince Charming" son, Michael I.
Nonetheless, Vizirescu accused him of being a disloyal "servant" of Crainic and an inconsistent, corrupt, ally of the Iron Guard.
Reportedly, Crevedia complained to his peers that Crainic was exploiting him.
Crevedia had another publicized row with the literary critic and historian George Călinescu—later, he acknowledged Călinescu as a "titan of his generation" and "one of our great prose writers", but still criticized him for "work[ing], year upon year, for the Jews".
He also applied his polemical energy to more personal causes, for instance attacking a putative former lover, Marta Rădulescu (daughter of the author Dan "Justus" Rădulescu), with a lampoon piece in "Viața Literară".
A resident of Cluj, she was locally famous as the editor of "Revista Mea", a mouthpiece of the Iron Guard.
They had allegedly been due to be married, and Rădulescu even wrote a short novel on the topic, but she eventually rejected him.
In such texts, Crevedia accused Marta of having stolen his writings—a claim dismissed by Vizirescu and later also by researcher Ion Chinezu.
In some of his notes on the scandal, Crevedia also claimed that Marta's ghostwriter was her father "Justus".
Crevedia took his final revenge on Rădulescu by having her satirized in the 1936 novel "Buruieni de dragoste" ("Love Weeds").
Some two years after the scandal, Crevedia married Maria Mutu, in a religious ceremony with Crainic as godfather.
Maria was a niece of the "Gândirea" novelist Gib Mihăescu, in whose house she lived before marriage; she worked as a professor of French and Romanian.
The couple had two daughters, Ioana and Diana.
A flight enthusiast, Crevedia continued to travel throughout Europe, and announced by 1937 that he was planning to publish a travelogue of his trips through the Balkans, a theatrical version of "Bacalaureatul lui Puiu", and an anthology of Bulgarian poetry, alongside a new novel, "Mămăligă"—referencing the folk dish.
His play was reportedly finished, and Crevedia failed at convincing Camil Petrescu to include it in the National Theater program.
Two other volumes of his poetry appeared around that time: "Maria" (1938), named after his wife, and "Dă-mi înapoi grădinile" ("Give Me Back My Gardens", 1939).
Still at "Porunca Vremii", Crevedia responded to left-wing adversaries of Crainic, primarily the novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, director of "Adevărul".
During the far-right's anti-Masonic campaign of 1936–1938, he mocked Sadoveanu's obesity and urged him to shoot himself.
In early 1937, at the height of the Spanish Civil War, he contributed to Iron Guard martyrology, depicting Romanian volunteers as "killed for Christ and the Latin race", seeds of "the iron phalanx of tomorrow."
However, later that year he and "Porunca Vremii" had switched their allegiances to the National Christian Party (PNC), which took fourth place in the December elections.
On January 1, 1938, Crevedia published an editorial calling for the PNC to take over and inaugurate a "new era" of antisemitic conservatism.
Before World War II, Crevedia was mainly contributing to "Universul", which was increasingly favorable to fascism.
In its literary supplement, he issued calls for a nationalist art, purified of "unhealthy, imported currents".
As noted by the satirist Neagu Rădulescu, these were prosperous times for Crevedia, who had a firm contract with publisher Petre Georgescu-Delafras.
At the time, he was keeping the aspiring novelist Constantin Virgil Gheorghiu as his salaried secretary and his "țuțăr" ("yes-man"), allowing him to wear his old clothes.
At the Writers' Society, he notes, Crevedia acted as a person of importance, but was told off by other writers.
As he moved up in his career, Crevedia built a modern home in his village, which he donated to his sister.
He continued to rely on rented housing, but purchased himself residential land in Băneasa, where, in 1940, he still hoped to build himself a family villa.
Under the Iron Guard's National Legionary State regime of late 1940, he directed Crainic's own fascist newspaper, "Sfarmă-Piatră".
In mid 1940 the Ion Antonescu government sent him as a press attaché in Sofia.
Serving there to 1946, he put together an edition on Romanian culture for "Serdika" and published "Cultura românească și centrul ei: Bucureștii" ("Romanian Culture and Its Center: Bucharest", 1943).
He also began translating Bulgarian poetry from the original, in the hope of publishing it, and also arranged for "an esteemed Bulgarian colleague" to work on similar translations from the Romanian.
No such work ever so print.
He continued to publish in "Universul", including 1941 verses which deplored the cession of Northern Transylvania to Romania's nominal ally, Regency Hungary, and claimed that Greater Romania would emerge again.
In 1943, he penned in "Viața Basarabiei" an eulogy to his fellow poet and friend, Octav Sargețiu, whom he thus brought to public attention.
==========
Although a fascist, Crevedia was spared during the first purge of the Writers' Society that followed the August 1944 Coup.
In July 1945, the Petru Groza government assessed his case and ruled: "From [Crevedia's] articles in "Porunca Vremii" one can discern a fully antisemitic campaign with incitement and exhortation of the most violent actions.
With his writing he serviced Hitlerism and fascism, popularizing hooligan, anti-democratic, frames of mind.
Since Nicolae Crevedia's actively fascist journalism is limited to the year 1939 and given that in later years he stopped putting out such articles, sanction shall be limited to a ban on activities, for no longer than 5 years."
Following the establishment of Romanian communist regime in 1948, he found himself shunned from mainstream literature, and continued to write, secretly, poems which explicitly contradicted the guidelines of socialist realism.
He resorted to informal channels, and, with Virgil Carianopol, Ion Buzdugan and Radu D. Rosetti, began frequenting the literary parties held at Ion Larian Postolache's home, on Dobroteasa Street, Bucharest.
This salon also grouped younger writers, including C. D. Zeletin and Crevedia's own son, Eugen.
According to one account, Postolache arranged for Crevedia to meet his son: they had been aware of each other, but never actually met, and Crevedia had heard that Barbu was reduced to poverty.
Barbu became more acceptable to the regime, and published in 1957 his own novel "The Pit", part of which fictionalizes Crevedia's youth.
According to a persistent rumor, the whole book was actually ghostwritten by Crevedia.
Crevedia clerked at the virology institute (1955–1956) and at the Romanian Academy's linguistics institute (1957), before being called on by the regime to edit "Glasul Patriei" magazine, from 1957 to 1972.
As noted by critic Ovid Crohmălniceanu, the latter enterprise, publishing propaganda aimed at the Romanian diaspora, was set up by former political prisoners Crainic and George Ivașcu, with Securitate agents as supervisors.
According to Crohmălniceanu, Crevedia and others, supposed to show the world that freedom of speech existed behind the Iron Curtain, were not in fact "old defenders of democracy", but "had rather filled [with their names] the old fascist press."
Following relative liberalization and national communism under Nicolae Ceaușescu, Crevedia returned to the public eye with a "Luceafărul" article on his meetings with Gib Mihăescu (1965), followed by the self-selected anthology "Versuri" ("Verse", 1968).
In 1969, with Vizirescu and Carianopol, alongside the Romanian Communist Party envoy Paul Niculescu-Mizil, he attended the official banquet marking Crainic's 80th birthday.
Reportedly, the same year he was also the first reviewer of Barbu's other novel, "Princepele", which he found to be a masterpiece.
Despite being left-wing and Jewish, Crohmălniceanu discovered that he liked the poetry of both Crainic and Crevedia, and made efforts to have it revisited; as he recounts, these were received with indignation by the communist poet Eugen Jebeleanu, who called Crevedia a "hooligan".
Crevedia himself was moved by Crohmălniceanu's work, and the two, later joined by Crainic, had cordial meetings in the early 1970s.
Before his 1978 death, Crevedia put out the anthology "Epigramiști români de ieri și de azi" ("Romanian Epigrammatists Past and Present", 1975) and included his previously unpublished verses in "Vinul sălbatic" ("Wild Wine", 1977).
Crevedia was survived by Barbu and his two half-sisters.
Diana Crevedia, married Cristev, worked for the Museum of Romanian Literature and was an editor of "Manuscriptum".
A translator of works by her more famous writer brother, she later emigrated to Italy.
Well regarded by the Ceaușescu regime, Barbu remained active at the forefront of Romanian politics and literature through to the 1989 Revolution.
A subset of Protochronist ideology, his cell of pro-Ceaușescu writers was sometimes known as the "Barbu Group", with Barbu himself co-opted on the Communist Party Central Committee; however, his reputation as an author suffered after revelations of plagiarism, and he was sidelined in the 1970s.
As editor of "Săptămîna", he cultivated poet Corneliu Vadim Tudor, famous for introducing antisemitic themes to the national-communist discourse.
Following the Revolution, Barbu, Tudor and Iosif Constantin Drăgan set up an ultra-nationalist Greater Romania Party.
==========
From early on, Crevedia created a reputation as a haughty, blustering countryside poet and as a prose writer inclined toward the licentious; gradually, his lyricism became purer and more temperate, in line with an authentic peasant traditionalism.
With Aron Cotruș, Radu Gyr, and other "Gândirea" poets, he exulted hajduk life, "bursting into explosions of vitality."
The "Gândirea" house critic, Ovidiu Papadima, referred to Crevedia as a traveler on the "imperial road of poetry", emanating "warm and full light".
When dealing with the poetic universe of Bucharest suburbia, Crevedia's work was infused with influences from Tudor Arghezi, who, Călinescu argues, was a "prototype", particularly with his "Mildew Flowers" cycle.
Nevertheless, the critic points out that the thick Wallachian dialect of Crevedia's prose was only suited for comedic situations and "facile subjects", not "great lyricism".
He viewed Crevedia as particularly hampered by his borrowings from the humorous verse of Ion Minulescu and his own "prankish temperament".
Crevedia and his friend George Dorul Dumitrescu both regarded Arghezi as "the prince of writers".
Also supporting the hypothesis that Crevedia's work was largely shaped by "Mildew Flowers", critic Șerban Cioculescu saw additional echoes from Sergei Yesenin, particularly in the "daring crudeness" of their shared vocabulary.
This view was toned down by poet Mihai Beniuc, who though a direct comparison between the Romanian and Russian poet was exaggerated.
Yesenian themes were traced by Cioculescu to poems such as "Ceai dansant" ("Tea Party"), which displays nostalgia for the countryside:
The modernist Eugen Lovinescu describes Crevedia as the most accomplished traditionalist, and notes that "Bulgări și stele" would have been a fully original work had it not been for "Mildew Flowers".
Crevedia's art was "neither folkloric nor a pastel, neither bucolic nor a fairy tale, and yet a rural poetry, or rather a plebeian poetry [...] of great plastic vigor, its vocabulary cruel to the brink of vulgarity and ugliness, but authentic".
According to C. D. Zeletin, Crevedia had a "rural obsession", but actually disliked Romanian folklore; behind the "impression of aggressiveness and primitivism", he was secretly inspired by Arghezi's more cultivated and urbanite literature.
Zeletin praised in particular Crevedia's use of alliteration and experiments with poetic language, arguing that they render a "savant charm".
Călinescu also noted that Crevedia's poetic homage to his father as a man "seemingly made from stumps and soil", had "a certain xylographic vigor"; Lovinescu also called it an "admirable woodcut".
Călinescu identified even "purer vibrations" in stanzas such as:
