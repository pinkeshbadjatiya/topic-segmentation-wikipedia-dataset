Ruby Buckton
Ruby Buckton is a fictional character from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera "Home and Away", played by Rebecca Breeds.
She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 20 June 2008.
Ruby was created by executive producer Cameron Welsh.
When she was first introduced she appeared to hide her problems and pretends to be strong.
She was characterised as a free spirited and independent girl.
Her storylines have consistently followed themes such as romance, unrequited love and rejection.
In what has been described as a "shock storyline" Ruby discovered her sister Charlie Buckton was in fact her mother.
This had subsequent effects in her character development.
She became out of place and confused about her life.
It destroyed her trust in Charlie and their relationship never recovered.
Ruby went on a journey of self-discovery and used men to redefine herself.
Her relationship with Xavier Austin was characterised through their mutual friendship, which ended through lack of passion.
She controversially fell in love with her music teacher Liam Murphy, the pair shared an emotional and creative connection through music.
Yet, her advances were unrequited and it created problems with her state of mind and began binge drinking.
Breeds felt the storyline differed to her romance with Xavier, as it showed Ruby "headstrong and unconfined".
Breeds felt they were ill-suited to one another.
Ruby later develops feelings for Romeo Smith and attempts to ruin his relationship with Indigo Walker.
Off-screen Breeds is dating Luke Mitchell who plays Romeo, they had both previously stated they did not want their characters to get together in case it created problems for them in real life.
Ruby and Romeo sleep together and after she is rejected, Ruby becomes wayward, self-harms and sleeps with Casey Braxton on the rebound.
The storyline also created more tension with Charlie who found it difficult to offer Ruby any parental advice.
In other minor storylines, Ruby has come to terms with having diabetes and discovered a talent for singing.
Breeds is a classically trained singer and she had to change her voice to suit Ruby's amateur vocals.
Ruby has received critical analysis through her storylines.
Some have branded her a "boyfriend-stealer", "self-absorbed" and a "randy school girl".
Her storylines with Liam were partially favoured to others.
Breeds has been nominated for the "Most Popular New Female Talent" and "Most Popular Actress" Logie Awards for her portrayal of Ruby.
==========
The serial's official website describes Ruby as being carefree, though she puts on a front to hide her emotions.
Ruby arrives grieving for the loss of her mother; unlike her sister, Ruby takes an "internal approach and bottled it up inside", creating a facade and appearing to be strong.
They also brand her as independent and she does not care what others think about her and is inclined to keep to herself.
Speaking of her aspirations in life, they add: "Her goal in life is simply to be happy and to be content in enjoying lifeâ€™s simpler things and the people in it."
Describing her character, portraying actress Rebecca Breeds stated: "Ruby has gone through a lot and had to gain a level of independence I really admire.
She is free-spirited and sure of whom she is.
I love playing Ruby; she is cheeky and easy-going, but very passionate about her family."
Breeds also described Ruby's hatred to being underestimated: "When people think something is beyond her, or she's too young, she gets twice as determined."
Ruby is often "prepared to be confrontational and abrasive".
She is often not careful in situations and is unaware of the consequences and what is coming up in the future.
Breeds said she is "idealistic and has high expectations" of herself and is a "very passionate" person, but is flawed by her "outspoken and brash" nature.
Breeds said that she can sympathise that she is irrational and silly because she is young.
==========
Ruby has a relationship with Xavier Austin (David Jones-Roberts), who initially messes her around.
Ruby decides to try and win Xavier back even after her initial heartbreak, of this Breeds states: "She pushes boundaries where I wouldn't and she has a lot of fun.
She thinks she is so mature, but she's really young and innocent."
Breeds explains her attraction to Xavier as "a challenge - she had to work for him and there is something mysterious and naughty about him but deep down she knows he is loyal and decent."
Their relationship ultimately ends after they grow apart.
Breeds said that Ruby and Xavier's relationship was a more "beautiful friendship and really good support" dynamic, rather than a romantic scenario.
She also said it was "lacking passion, which everyone deserves.
It's there but it's not there enough."
Ruby later starts to have feelings for Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell).
Of the storyline Breeds states: "It's going to be the easiest thing I've ever had to do.
There's no acting involved at all.
But he's got a girlfriend so Ruby has to find a way to justify going after someone who has a girlfriend.
So that's kind of hard.
But he's the hero.
She believes he's the love of her life.
I guess with that in mind you wouldn't let anything get in the way of that.
Who knows, he might be."
However Breeds previously revealed she did not want the pair to romance each other, due to her real life relationship with Mitchell.
Mitchell himself had also revealed he did not want the pair to start a romance.
In comparison to her willingness to take him from Indigo, Breeds said Ruby would not have done the same whilst Romeo was with her best friend Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best).
Mitchell revealed that Romeo's relationship with Indigo Walker (Samara Weaving) would drift apart in the event of the "love triangle" storyline.
Executive producer Cameron Welsh promised viewers that the storyline would play a big part of the serial in 2011.
He also stated: "Fans will definitely take sides on this one.
Luke Mitchell, Rebecca Breeds and Samara Weaving are having a great time with this storyline, and we'll see a new side to all of them as they face the consequences of their actions."
Breeds later explained Ruby's reasoning and the hidden issue which makes her believe she loves him so quickly stating: "Ruby has a lot of insecurity because Ruby never really had a father figure.
There's a lot of looking to belong and looking for love because she's had a displaced family life, and she feels like Romeo is her family.
Romeo has some issues of his own.
He is struggling with his relationship with Indi.
The pair find themselves in a similar place of understanding."
After Romeo sleeps with Ruby, Mitchell said Romeo immediately regrets it.
Ruby then decides to reveals the truth to Indigo.
This ruins their friendship and Weaving said: "I think that friendship is pretty much over now!
".
Ruby has a brief fling with Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes) after her romance with Romeo ends.
When Ruby realises that Romeo is back with his girlfriend, she sleeps with Casey.
He then takes "great pleasure" in revealing the details about Ruby's relationship with Romeo.
==========
In another storyline her sister Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) reveals she is in fact her mother.
The reveal episode centered around Ruby interrogating Charlie about the identity of her secret child, with Charlie breaking down whilst she admits the truth.
Whilst filming the episodic block, both Breeds and Anderson found the storyline challenging; furthermore they felt a responsibility to get the narrative flow and emotions perfect.
Breeds said she had to let it affect her own emotions in order to affect the viewing public.
Although she was nervous, Breeds was pleased with the end result.
The revelation ruins their relationship.
The actresses shared insight: "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air"; whilst Charlie was "trying desperately to bridge this gap" The events impact Ruby's self-identity, leaving her feeling confused and her backstory succumb the distortion Charlie causes.
Ruby starts to ask herself questions such as "Where do I stand now with everything?"
and "How do I reconcile this?".
Breeds said it was a "big exploration" and "a journey" for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing.
Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from."
She said that ultimately everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong.
Furthermore, she said "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it is a bit of a journey."
Charlie later struggles to deal with Ruby's relationship with Casey.
Discussing Charlie's motives, Anderson stated: "Ruby's at that age where she is quite impressionable, and Charlie doesn't want to see her getting hurt.
She's only very recently been in a relationship with Romeo, and Charlie is concerned about her moving from one guy to the next too quickly."
Casey's brother Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) tries to advise Ruby through her troubles.
Although she was not prepared to listen, Darryl gave her a new understanding, a development that is said to "surprise" Ruby.
Questioned about Ruby's situation Anderson opined: "He offers the first bit of good advice that she's heard in relation to parenting so, as much as she doesn't want to admit it, he does get through."
==========
Ruby has fallen in love with two of her teachers during her tenure.
The first being Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart).
Breeds said it was a "genuine teenage infatuation" and Ruby was "drawn to his maturity" rather than his physical appearance.
Quong Tart said Miles was "taken back" by the kiss him and the subsequent investigation he faces from the school board.
Ruby later becomes good friends with her music teacher Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead).
They work closely together and Ruby develops feelings for him.
The storyline creates many hurdles for the characters and highlights "controversial negotiation" in its themes.
This sees Ruby experience a "different kind of love" than she felt for Xavier.
At this point Breeds said: "She's matured a bit and is exploring different parts of herself and love."
Through Liam she was "realising something she's passionate about, and being encouraged in her creativity with her music."
It is the intoxication of the situation that has been misappropriated to Liam.
Breeds opined they shared "really strong chemistry emotionally and creatively."
She said Ruby is ignorant to the fact he is her teacher by virtue of the fact she is feeling "headstrong and doesn't confine herself to boxes."
Ruby was initially in denial of her feelings, she realised it was "controversial" â€“ Yet, ultimately she decided to be true to her feelings.
Breeds acknowledged that from a musical stand point someone who inspires you creatively and acts as your muse, is a special bond.
She attributed it to Liam's feelings for Ruby.
Ruby and Liam continue to act a support unit for one another.
As the scholarship develops they talk to each other about "mature things that surpass a student-teacher relationship."
Liam later develops feelings for Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and Ruby is seeing Liam slip from her grasp.
Breeds said "She sees them flirting and she has a moment where she realises that she's so in love with this guy and it's kind of now or never.
She needs to take action."
True to Ruby's persona she does not preconceive her actions and Ruby feels she has to "set the record straight and to give it a really good crack."
For Ruby it is a spontaneous, impromptu moment; "She's just totally spilling out with feelings for him."
However Liam is forced to maintain his responsibility.
Breeds attributes this to the fact he has a "professional career to think about it.
He's not a teenager, so he's in a different place.
I think it's very confusing for him.
Liam issued a firm warning that he would terminate their professional relationship if her feelings became uncontrollable.
Breeds subsequently stated she did not think Liam was right for Ruby.
She said the ideal scenario for the pair would be "in a different lifetime and if they were closer in age.
It would have been beautiful if there weren't logistics standing in the way."
Ruby then cannot handle rejection and turns to alcohol for comfort and to "numb her feelings".
Aside from the romantic theme in her storyline Ruby has been shown as an aspiring singer.
Breeds is classically trained in real life and said she doesn't mind singing on camera.
Discussing this she stated: "When you're playing a character you can hide behind them.
I know it's still my voice, [...] I was more confident singing from Ruby's point of view.
Even though there was a storyline where she was terrified about singing in a school play, I wasn't nervous at all.
I had to try really hard to make myself feel nervous."
She revealed she had to play down her voice and make it "a bit cleaner" and a "bit more inexperienced".
This was due to the fact it was meant to be that she had never sung before â€“ "I have to pull her back a bit."
She added the storyline was realistic because there are no set guidelines for discovering vocal talent.

Breeds told Miller that she could not discuss her departure because of her contract with the series.
She added that "Ruby is still very much alive, I'm not free of Ruby just yet".
