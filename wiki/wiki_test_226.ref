==========
Chris Redfield debuted in the original "Resident Evil" as one of the playable protagonists, along with Jill Valentine, partnered with the rookie officer Rebecca Chambers.
He is introduced as a former U.S. military pilot hailing from New York City, and a member of the Raccoon City Police Special Tactics And Rescue Service's (STARS) Alpha team which was sent to investigate the disappearance of Bravo team after their helicopter went missing in a nearby forest.
Chris, accompanied by Albert Wesker, Barry Burton and Jill Valentine, soon find themselves trapped in the nearby mansion, which is filled with horrific monsters and deadly traps.
Chris's scenario is more challenging than Jill's, as he has a smaller carrying capacity and lacks certain items.
He is also not equipped with a lockpick and so needs to find small desk keys.
On the other hand, Chris can take a lot more damage from enemies than Jill.
In the end, Chris and his comrades discover how the nightmare began and witness the death of Albert Wesker, who was betraying them all along, and they face and kill a prototype Tyrant released by Wesker.
Following the so-called "Mansion Incident", Chris left Raccoon City, embarking on a personal mission against Umbrella.
Chris returns in "Resident Evil Code: Veronica", set five months later.
As the protagonist of the second half of the game, he attempts to rescue his younger sister, Claire, from the Umbrella Corporation's research facilities on Rockfort Island and in Antarctica.
Upon discovering she is now in Antarctica, Chris is briefly confronted by Wesker, seeking revenge on Chris for having destroyed his plans.
Eventually, he confronts Alexia Ashford, the creator of the T-Veronica virus.
At the end of the game, he fights with Wesker shortly after killing Alexia.
He is no match for Wesker, and their fight is cut short due to the imminent destruction of the base.
They vow to finish things another time.
Chris was one of the main characters of "", in which he reunites with Jill Valentine.
Parts of the game are essentially a retelling of "Resident Evil".
The two of them join a private biohazard containment force and in 2003 embark on a mission to destroy the Umbrella Corporation after hearing rumours of a new BOW being developed, resulting in their successful attack on an Umbrella facility located in Russia's Caucasus region.
Chris is the protagonist of "Resident Evil 5", in which he is a founding member of the UN paramilitary group Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).
In the game, Chris investigates a terrorist threat in Kijuju, Africa while looking for Jill, who is missing and presumed dead.
Accompanying him is his new partner Sheva Alomar.
Eventually, they manage to find and free Jill, and to ultimately defeat and destroy Wesker who was planning to release a new virus into the atmosphere, ensuring complete global saturation.
Chris makes an appearance in "" as a playable character in the "Game of Oblivion" scenario's final chapter, a re-imagining of "Code: Veronica".
He is also available in the Extreme Battle mode featured in the later versions of "Resident Evil 2" (the PlayStation 2 DualShock edition and the PC, Dreamcast and GameCube ports), and is one of the eight playable characters in "".
Chris returned in "", with Jill Valentine.
After co-founding the BSAA, Chris is sent by director Clive R. O'Brian to investigate the return of the terrorist group, Il Veltro, with his new partner, Jessica Sherawat.
In the mountain range of Finland, the two lose contact with the BSAA, but they find Il Veltro's air base.
After reestablishing contact, Chris and Jessica learn that Jill and Parker Luciani have gone missing while searching for them.
Eventually, Chris and Jessica find them on the "Queen Zenobia" ship.
Chris teams up with Jill once again to neutralize the t-Abyss virus.
O'Brian then directs them to another ship, "Queen Dido", where they find Il Veltro leader, Jack Norman, who injects himself with the t-Abyss virus.
After a grueling fight, the two find a video that contains evidence of the crimes of Morgan Lansdale, director of the Federal Bioterrorism Commission who was behind everything.
Chris returns as one of the three protagonists of "Resident Evil 6", alongside Leon S. Kennedy, and Jake Muller, the son of Albert Wesker.
In the game, Chris was assigned to investigate a bio-terrorist attack in the fictional country of Edonia, but nearly loses all his team members following a BOW attack by an woman identifying herself as Ada Wong.
Unbeknownst to him, the woman is actually Ada's doppelgänger, Carla Radames.
Chris resigns from the BSAA shortly afterwards, and becomes an alcoholic due to depression.
He is eventually convinced by another survivor of his ill-fated team, Piers Nivans, to rejoin the BSAA and confront another bio-terrorist attack in the fictional city of Lanshiang, China.
Because of his lust for revenge against Carla, he loses almost all his men to the BOW's, except for Piers.
After chasing down Carla to a warehouse, before he can execute her, Chris is interrupted by Leon who manages to make him let go of his desire for vengeance.
Chris and Piers pursue Carla to her freighter, where she reveals her plan to recreate the Raccoon City incident on a global scale.
But she is then killed by an assassin on a helicopter, leaving behind an enhanced strain of the C-virus.
Chris and Piers are then asked by Leon to save Jake Muller, Albert Wesker's son who has antibodies for the C-virus.
Rescuing him and Sherry Birkin in an underwater facility, Chris confronts Jake about killing his father.
Although he holds Chris at gunpoint, Jake decides to learn everything from him once they escape.
But a giant BOW, HAOS, awakens and attacks them.
As Jake and Sherry make their escape, Chris and Piers fight the BOW.
But during the fight, Piers' right arm is crippled, pushing him to inject himself with the C-virus from Carla to save Chris from HAOS.
As they make their escape, Chris is pushed into the escape pod alone by Piers, who knows that he will soon lose his humanity.
As the pod escapes, HAOS attacks Chris but Piers shoots it down before he is killed.
After being rescues by the BSAA, Chris continues to serve them in Piers' honor and memory.

He, Alice and Claire eventually defeat Albert Wesker and rescue imprisoned survivors being used for Umbrella's experiments.

Hideki Kamiya described Chris as a "blunt, tough-guy type," admitting that he was a fan of this archetype.
"Resident Evil 5" producer Jun Takeuchi said that the series' fans "would really love" a video game featuring both Chris and Leon S. Kennedy as the protagonists due to their popularity, and it would be "pretty dramatic" if the two characters never met when the series ended.
Reuben Langdon did Chris' motion capture for several "Resident Evil" games.
He found Chris "fun to play" based on his look and characterization.
Chris' increased muscle mass in the game was to show that he had trained heavily in order to fight the series' powerful villain Albert Wesker bare-handed.
Modeler Yosuke Yamagata added that they "made a new design that retained their signature color — green for Chris, blue for Jill — to carry over the same look from the past.
The facial structures are mainly based on the visuals of the GameCube version, and we added various details to these in order to develop a realistic structure."
For the sixth main game, Chris has been redesigned slightly, as he now has a slightly disheveled look due to his alcoholism, and has been slimmed down to a much normal musculature along with a slightly shaved head.
In 2009, GameTrailers made a video focusing on his evolution throughout the series.
