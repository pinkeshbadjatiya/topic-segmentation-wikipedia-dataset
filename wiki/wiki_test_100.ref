==========
The 2011 ATP World Tour Finals took place from 20–27 November at the O Arena in London, United Kingdom.
It was the 42nd edition of the tournament (36th in doubles).
The tournament was run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and was part of the 2011 ATP World Tour.
The event took place on indoor hard courts.
It served as the season-ending championships for players on the ATP Tour.
The eight players who qualify for the event are split into two groups of four.
During this stage, players compete in a round-robin format (meaning players play against all the other players in their group).
The two players with the best results in each group progress to the semifinals, where the winners of a group faces the runners-up of the other group.
This stage, however, is a knock-out stage.
The doubles competition uses the same format.
==========
The top eight players (or teams) with the most countable points accumulated in Grand Slam, ATP World Tour, and Davis Cup tournaments during the year qualify for the 2011 Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.
Countable points include points earned in 2011, plus points earned at the 2010 Davis Cup final and the late-season 2010 Challengers played after the 2010 Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.
To qualify, a player who finished in the 2010 year-end top 30 must compete in four Grand Slam tournaments and eight ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments during 2011.
In addition, his best four ATP World Tour 500 events in 2011 and his best two ATP World Tour 250 events in 2011 count towards his ranking.
All direct acceptance players at the time of the entry deadline who do not play an event receive a 0-pointer for that event.
The Monte Carlo Rolex Masters 1000 became optional in 2009, but if a player chooses to participate in it, its result is counted in and his fourth-best result in an ATP 500 event is ignored (his three best ATP 500 results remain).
If a player does not play enough ATP 500 events and does not have an ATP 250 or Challenger appearance with a better result, the Davis Cup is counted in the 500s table (if the player entered or achieved better results).
If a player does not play enough ATP 250 or Challenger events, the World Team Championship is counted in the 250s table (if the player entered or achieved better results).
If a player could not be present in all required tournament classes (i.e.
because of an injury), all uncounted ATP 250 or Challenger results are eligible to be included in his 18 valid tournaments.
In teams rankings, Challenger points are excluded.
A player who is out of competition for 30 or more days, due to a verified injury, is not penaltized.
The 2011 Barclays ATP World Tour Finals counts as an additional 19th tournament in the ranking of its eight qualifiers at season's end, while the Davis Cup Final points count towards the next year's race.
