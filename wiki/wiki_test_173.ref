5"".
Their first success outside the Russian language area was in May 2004 with the single ""Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
"", an English version of their 2002 Russian song.

The group was co-created by Dmitriy Kostyuk and Konstantin Meladze.
Kostyuk is the manager of the group and the co-producer of the group's albums.

Стоп!
Стоп!"

They released the music video for the song the following summer.
In September a new song and video, “Good morning, papa!” were released, upon which time Nadya had returned, and for the first and only time, there were four girls in the group.
