Big Brother 9 (U.S.)
Big Brother 9, also known as Big Brother: 'Til Death Do You Part, was the ninth season of the American reality television series "Big Brother".

Following the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike, the trade magazine "Variety" reported that CBS, in response, was considering airing a winter edition of "Big Brother", and that the network started cast auditions.
Several sites speculated that the winter edition could have been an American version of "Celebrity Big Brother" but this was untrue as CBS released a statement that the next edition of "Big Brother" would be a regular season following the format of past editions.
The season was announced on November 15, 2007 with open casting calls being held from November 17, 2007 to December 8, 2007.

House pictures were released on February 6, 2008.
The house has an outdoors theme due to this being the first season to air during the winter season.
The house also includes a theme of love, in alignment with the season's twist.
Throughout the house, there are numerous love quotes written by Oscar Wilde, William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
In the dining room and kitchen, the furniture are in bright red and yellow colors, and logs stacked against each other fill up a wall.
The walkway to the Head of Household room evokes a giant library.
The Head of Household room is an exotic island oasis.
The headboard is made from a surfboard, there are Hula girl table lamps, rattan carpet and Polynesian knickknacks.
The boat bedroom features shelves and chests designed to resemble small rowboats with rowboat shaped beds.
Two large beds made of actual unfinished tree branches with pink bedspreads fill another room.
The living room features a giant green semi-circular sofa, and a stone wall fireplace.
A red colored room connected directly to the living room by a short hallway, with no doors, has a pair of pullout couches rather than actual beds.

The lounge area features a fire pit and heated lamps.
Along with work-out equipment, there are lawn chairs to lay out in the sun.

==========
The format remains largely unchanged from previous seasons.
HouseGuests are sequestered in the Big Brother House with no contact to or from the outside world.
Each week, the HouseGuests take part in several compulsory challenges that determine who will win food, luxuries, and power in the House.
The winner of the weekly Head of Household competition is immune from nominations and must nominate two fellow HouseGuests for eviction.
After a HouseGuest becomes Head of Household, he or she is ineligible to take part in the next Head of Household competition.
HouseGuests also take part in competitions to earn food for the week.
The losing team will be forced to eat Big Brother Slop for the week.
This is the second season to feature Slop as the punishment food, as it was originally peanut butter and jelly.
The winner of the Power of Veto competition wins the right to save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction.
If the Veto winner exercises the power, the Head of Household must then nominate another HouseGuest for eviction.
On eviction night, all HouseGuests except for the Head of Household and the two nominees vote to evict one of the two nominees.
This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room by the host Julie Chen.
In the event of a tie, the Head of Household must cast the deciding vote, announcing it in front of the other HouseGuests.
Unlike other versions of "Big Brother", the HouseGuests may discuss the nomination and eviction process openly and freely.
The nominee with the greater number of votes will be evicted from the House on the live Thursday broadcast, exiting to an adjacent studio to be interviewed by Chen.
HouseGuests may voluntarily leave the House at any time and those who break the rules may be expelled from the house by Big Brother.
The final seven HouseGuests evicted during the season will vote for the winner on the season finale.
These "Jury Members" will be sequestered in a separate house and will not be allowed to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests.
The jury members will not be shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that include strategy or details regarding nominations.
This season featured numerous twists to the format.
The main twist this season saw the HouseGuests competing as couples; they competed as couples, were nominated as couples, and were evicted as couples.
This twist went on until the third week, when the couples were told they could officially play as individuals.
Another twist this season saw a previously evicted HouseGuest returning to the game on Day 35, with the returning HouseGuest decided partly by the HouseGuests themselves.
This season also introduced the Power Couple twist, in which the winners of this title were required to evict one couple from the house in a matter of a few days.

Matt McDonald participated in a food competition for the "following season", which featured a representative from each previous season.
Matt McDonald is the only Houseguest from "Big Brother 9" to appear on a future season of Big Brother.
==========
On Day 1, the original sixteen HouseGuests entered the house.
HouseGuests Jen and Ryan, a couple outside of the house, were aware of each other's presence while ex-couple Jacob and Sharon were surprised to find one another in the house.
Following their entrance, the HouseGuests learned of the season's twist, in which they would be partnered with their "soulmate" and compete as a couple.
The HouseGuests then learned the identity of their soulmates; Adam & Sheila were paired together, while Alex & Amanda, Allison & Ryan, Chelsia & James, Jacob & Sharon, Jen & Parker, Joshuah & Neil, and Matt & Natalie were paired together.
HouseGuests Adam & Sheila immediately began to clash, annoying their fellow HouseGuests.
The couples then learned of the Power Couple twist, in which the winner of this title would choose to evict one of the couples from the house in a matter of days.
HouseGuests then competed in the "Falling For You" Power Couple competition.
For this competition, one person from each couple was hooked onto a zipline, while their partner had to hold onto them while being suspended in the air.
The last couple remaining suspended without falling would be the winning team.
Midway through the competition, it was revealed that if a couple managed to get a pillow laying below them and went on to win the competition, they would earn a $10,000 prize.
Ultimately, Jen & Parker won the Power Couple competition, as well as the $10,000 prize.
On Day 2, in an attempt to cause drama, Jacob began telling some of the HouseGuests that Parker was a "snake" and not to trust him.
When Jen found out, she informed Parker of this, leading to a confrontation during which Jacob claimed he had been told this by another HouseGuest.
Sharon, in an attempt to save herself and her partner, implied to Parker that Ryan had made the statement.
Fearing that Parker would vote to evict Ryan, Jen informed Parker that she and Ryan were a couple outside of the house; Ryan then told Allison, as he felt it was unfair for her not to know.

Joshuah & Sharon were the winners.
Shortly following their win, Joshuah and Allison engaged in numerous verbal arguments due to Joshuah being mad at Allison for changing her vote last minute, as well as the lesbian lie she had told earlier in the game.
