In an interview that aired on 18 May 2011 on the television programme "North East Tonight", McElderry made his first public comments about his departure from the company.
In radio interviews during the month of July 2011, McElderry spoke further about the circumstances of the end of his relationship with Syco.
He told Terry Wogan in an interview on BBC Radio 2 that he had actually parted ways with Syco in February 2011.
In an interview with Real Radio that aired on 13 July 2011, McElderry, when speaking about his commercial struggles, said: "I think a lot of it was to do with the fact that I went away for so long...
I think we left it a bit too late with releasing the album.
But I think it's also down to the label."
He said that there were "timing issues" and, "We missed out on a few things".
On 14 July 2011, McElderry told BBC Newcastle that he "wasn't happy" when he was with Syco.
He said that Syco had made mistakes "timing-wise" and in "the marketing side of things."
He added that he was "happy" with his album, "Wide Awake," although, if he had to do it over again, "maybe" he would have included "a few more ballads."
But he added that the album's songs gave him "some great fast material" to perform alongside ballads when he performed live, and also said that, when he was making the album, he wanted to show that he could be "diverse" and perform fast songs as well as ballads of the type that he had performed on X Factor.
McElderry told Tony Horne that he had a meeting with Syco staff members in February 2011.
He told Radio Newcastle that, at the meeting, he expressed his unhappiness with the company, and said to the staff members that the relationship with Syco was not working for him.
According to McElderry, the staff members said that the relationship was not working for the company either, and all concerned agreed to go their separate ways.
McElderry also told BBC Newcastle: "I just needed to go out and explore on my own and fend for myself a bit instead of being in this huge kind of establishment that kind of protected us.
I needed to go out there and be a proper artist and fend for myself, by myself, and do things my way."
McElderry has also stated that his split with Syco was amicable, and there was no "fight" between them.
He told Tony Horne, "I'm still great friends with all the team there."
He told the Shields Gazette: "I really like Simon Cowell and always think very highly of him.
.
.
.
There's no hard feelings there — there never has been and never will be."

He said in the same interview that he was "a massive fan" of "X Factor".
He also denied the report (attributed to an unnamed "friend" in the "Daily Mail"s article about Syco's dropping of him) that he was "devastated" when Syco dropped him.
He said in radio interviews that he had not been "depressed."
He told the "Sunday Mirror": "Being dumped by Syco wasn't the end of my world — it was the opposite.
I'm actually glad it happened.
People were coming up to me thinking I was going to be depressed but I honestly wasn't.
My thoughts were, 'Right, let's get on with it and work out what to do next.'"
Later, he told "Out in the City" magazine: "I mean this in the least big-headed way possible, but it wasn't a depressing time.
Obviously, getting dropped by your record label is not an ideal situation, but I just kind of thought, 'OK, what's next?
Let's move on to the next chapter'.
I didn't dwell on it.
I don't want to say that I wasn't bothered because obviously I care about my music, but I kind of thought: 'Right, let's go out and explore who I'm going to release music with next'.
It was an exciting time, as well as being a kind of wake-up, I suppose".
Also in 2011, McElderry terminated his relationship with Modest!

He subsequently hired Angie Jenkison as his new manager.
