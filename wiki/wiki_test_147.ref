Taboo Tuesday (2004)
Taboo Tuesday (2004) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and presented by AT&T which took place on October 19, 2004 at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
It was the first annual Taboo Tuesday event, marking the first time in which the fans were given the chance to vote on stipulations for the matches.
The voting for the event started on October 18, 2004 and ended during the event.
Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card.
The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before, during, and after the event were planned by WWE's script writers.
The event starred wrestlers from the Raw brand: a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner.
The main event was a Steel cage match, which is fought in a cage with four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against the edges of the wrestling ring, in which Randy Orton defeated Ric Flair by pinfall.
Two bouts were featured on the undercard.
In respective singles matches, World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defeated Shawn Michaels to retain his title and Gene Snitsky defeated Kane in a Weapon of Choice match, a match in which the use of foreign objects, which is usually illegal under the standard rules of professional wrestling, is allowed.
Taboo Tuesday grossed over $215,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 3,500 and received 174,000 pay-per-view buys.
This event helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $6.2m compared to the previous year.
When the event was released on DVD, it reached a peak position of seventh on "Billboard's" DVD Sales Chart.
Taboo Tuesday was the first regularly-scheduled pay-per-view held by WWE on a Tuesday since 1991's This Tuesday in Texas, the first regularly-scheduled non-Sunday pay-per-view since the 1994 Survivor Series, and the first non-Sunday pay-per-view of any kind since 2 in 1996.
==========
Unlike most WWE events, where rules and participants for matches were determined by WWE's creative staff, this was the first event where at least some part of each match was determined by votes from WWE fans conducted on WWE's official website.
The event was scheduled to feature eight professional wrestling matches.
Various wrestlers were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines leading to the matches taking place at this event.
Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or fan favorites as they followed a series of tension-building events.
The event featured wrestlers and other talent from the Raw brand – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its on-air talent to separate television brands.
The main event at Taboo Tuesday was a match between Randy Orton and Ric Flair where the online fan vote would determine whether the match was a steel cage match, a Falls Count Anywhere match, or a submission match.
On the September 27, 2004, episode of "Raw" — one of WWE's primary television programs — Orton was given an opportunity to face Triple H at Taboo Tuesday for the World Heavyweight Championship if he was able to win a match against Batista, but he was not able to do so.
During the singles match, Ric Flair interfered on behalf of Batista.
This led to Orton blaming his loss on Flair.
Orton commented on everything Flair had accomplished in the WWE and criticized him for calling Triple H the greatest wrestler of all.
Flair responded to Orton's comments.
He asserted that despite Orton's claim of being a "Legend Killer", wrestlers whom he had defeated such as Shawn Michaels and Mick Foley are not truly legends and therefore do not make Orton a true "Legend Killer".
Flair also announced that he and Orton would meet in a match at Taboo Tuesday and the fans would have the opportunity to choose what type of match they would compete in.
One of the featured matches on the under-card was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H would have to defend the title against the fans' choice of three possible opponents: Chris Benoit, Edge, or Shawn Michaels.
At Unforgiven, Raw's previous pay-per-view event, Triple H defeated Randy Orton to capture the World Heavyweight Championship.
The following night on "Raw", Triple H had a celebration thrown in his honor, complete with women, confetti, streamers and a giant cake.
Orton, however, sought revenge by coming out of the cake and assaulting the three members of Evolution, Triple H's stable with Ric Flair and Batista, which Orton had previously been a part of.
On the October 4 episode of "Raw", it was announced that because Orton has not won the opportunity to challenge Triple H, fans would be able to choose between three potential contenders for Triple H's World title at Taboo Tuesday.
Chris Benoit and Edge were revealed as two of the candidates.
Shawn Michaels, however, competed in a qualifying match, which saw him defeat Christian, to become the third candidate.
On the October 18 episode of "Raw", a standard match involving three wrestlers, called a Triple Threat match, was scheduled between Benoit, Edge, and Michaels.
Edge won the match after he pinned Benoit by using the ring ropes for unfair leverage.
During the match, Michaels legitimately injured his left knee, tearing his meniscus.
The other featured preliminary match was between Kane and Gene Snitsky.
At Unforgiven, Shawn Michaels defeated Kane in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference.
The next night on "Raw", Kane demanded that authority figure Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match-maker and rule-enforcer, give him a rematch against Michaels, but Bischoff refused to do so as Michaels was preoccupied with appearing in Chris Jericho's interview segment, "The Highlight Reel".
Bischoff, however, scheduled Kane in a no disqualification match against an opponent of Bischoff's choice.
Kane's opponent was revealed to be Gene Snistky.
During the match, Kane's scripted wife, Lita, who was pregnant in the storyline, entered the ring.
This led to Kane accidentally falling on top of her after Snitsky hit Kane with a steel chair, ending the match.
Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took Lita away in an ambulance for medical attention.
The following week, Kane was informed by doctors that Lita suffered a scripted miscarriage following the events of the previous week.
On the September 27 episode of "Raw", in an interview with Todd Grisham, Kane informed Grisham that he sought revenge against Snitsky for his actions.
The following week, Lita gave her first interview since the miscarriage and revealed that she and Kane would get payback against Snitsky.
During the same episode, Snitsky was interviewed by Raw commentator Jim Ross and told Ross that the death of the couple's unborn child was not his fault.
Kane interrupted the interview segment, but Snitsky attacked Kane with a lead pipe in self-defense.
This led Bischoff to announce a Weapon of Choice match for Taboo Tuesday, where fans would be able to vote on whether a lead pipe, a steel chain, or a steel chair would be legal for use in the match.
The main Divas feud entering the event was between Christy Hemme and Carmella DeCesare, the two finalists in the Raw Diva Search.
On the September 20 episode of "Raw", Christy was announced as the winner of the Diva Search and received a one-year contract with WWE and $250,000.
After the Diva Search, Carmella became a villainess and began a feud with Christy, due to jealousy of Christy winning the Diva Search.
On the last edition of "Raw" before Taboo Tuesday, it was announced that Christy and Carmella would face each other at the pay-per-view with the fans choosing what type of match they would compete in.
The choices were a Lingerie Pillow Fight, an Evening Gown Match, or an Aerobics Challenge.
After the announcement was made, Carmella attacked Christy.

The first to be eliminated was Nidia, which was followed with the elimination of Jazz.
Kim performed a hurricanrana on Victoria, a move that is executed by jumping forward and straddling on a standing opponent's shoulders, but Victoria countered the move as she sent Kim out of the ring, thus being eliminated from the match.
Victoria was eliminated afterwards by both Stratus and Molly, after they double teamed Victoria.
Stratus and Molly continued working together, as they got the upper hand over Keibler.
Molly eliminated Keibler from the match.
This led Stratus to catch Molly off-guard, as she pushed her through the ropes to retain her WWE Women's Championship.

The match was a Weapons of Choice match, which gained 41% of the vote.

WWE Chairman Vince McMahon came out and reversed the stipulation and announced that Bischoff would get his head shaved.
McMahon warned that if Bischoff did not go through it, he would be fired.
Eugene shaved Bischoff's hair and Coachman was forced to wear a dress for messing up the outcome of the match.
The fifth match was for the World Tag Team Championships between La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Robért Conway) against Edge and Chris Benoit, the two individuals who were not chosen to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight championship.
There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all the superstars were able to participate in the match.
Edge abandoned Benoit during the match, which forced Benoit to wrestle both members of La Résistance by himself.
Benoit fought them off, and he was able to get the upper hand over Grenier.
The match concluded with Benoit winning the World Tag Team Championship, after he locked his hands together and pulled Conway's face and pulling his neck backwards, a move which Benoit calls the Crippler Crossface, making Conway submit to the hold.

==========
Following Taboo Tuesday, Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) were put in charge of "Raw", after Eric Bischoff took the night off, following his match the night before.
Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch against Randy Orton, as he lost a steel cage match to Orton the previous night.
Orton accepted Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at the November pay-per-view Survivor Series.
Orton did not receive the opportunity, as he lost to Flair.
On the November 1 episode of "Raw", Bischoff scheduled a traditional 8-man elimination tag team match involving Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Maven and Chris Benoit) facing off against Team Triple H (Triple H, Batista, Edge and Gene Snitsky) at Survivor Series.
The winning team would be granted absolute control of running the show for a month, and the winning members would all get a week to be in charge of the program.
At the November event, Team Orton defeated Team Triple H and the team were given the opportunity to be in charge of Raw for a week.
On the October 25 episode of "Raw", a rematch for the Intercontinental Championship was scheduled between Shelton Benjamin and Chris Jericho.
The match saw Benjamin defeat Jericho and retain the title.
After the match, Benjamin was attacked by Christian, which led Christian to overhook Benjamin's arms and pivoted him to an 180° thus driving his face onto the mat, a move Christian calls the Unprettier.
The following week, Bischoff scheduled an Intercontinental championship match between Benjamin and Christian at Survivor Series.
At Survivor Series, Benjamin retained the Intercontinental championship.
In November 2004, Lita returned to the women's division.
She began a feud with Trish Stratus after Stratus called Lita "chubby" because of her pregnancy weight gain.
Lita challenged Stratus to a WWE Women's Championship match at Survivor Series, however, due to the months of humiliation and being verbally berated by Stratus, Lita was more concerned with doing as much damage as possible, leading to her disqualification.
