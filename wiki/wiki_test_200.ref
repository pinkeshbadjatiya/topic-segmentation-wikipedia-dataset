Sonya Mitchell
Sonya Rebecchi (also Mitchell) is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera "Neighbours", played by Eve Morey.
The actress successfully auditioned for the role and began filming in June 2009.
She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 14 August 2009.
Sonya was initially introduced as a recurring guest character, but Morey was promoted to the regular cast in July 2010.
Sonya is portrayed as being good-hearted, funny and loving.
She was once addicted to alcohol and gambling, but moved to Erinsborough for a fresh start.
While working as a guide dog trainer, Sonya met Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and they began dating, but the relationship ended when Toadie got back together with his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner).
However, once Sonya learned the relationship was a sham, she agreed to wait for Toadie and they eventually got back together.
Sonya's younger sister, Jade (Gemma Pranita), was later introduced.
Sonya and Jade initially had a rocky relationship, but became more supportive of each other.
Jade's arrival also precipitated the revelation that Sonya is Callum Jones's (Morgan Baker) biological mother.
Other storylines for the character have seen her open her own garden nursery and give birth to a daughter.
Sonya has become popular with viewers and Morey has received nominations for Best Daytime Star at the 2011 and 2012 Inside Soap Awards.

Morey successfully auditioned for the role of Sonya and joined the cast in June 2009 in a recurring capacity.
Morey made her first screen appearance as Sonya during the episode broadcast on 14 August 2009.
A year later, it was announced that Sonya had been promoted to the regular cast and a writer for Holy Soap said that viewers would be seeing a lot more of her in the future.
In February 2011, Morey signed a new contract to stay with "Neighbours" for another year.
She told the "Daily Star", "It was great to know I'd be working for a year – from a struggling actor's point of view that is fantastic.
But it also meant there is a year's worth of developing the character because she will become part of the bigger storylines instead of supporting."
Morey added that she was loving her time on the show and the people she was working with.
==========
Sonya is an animal lover who has previously worked for Guide Dogs Victoria.
She is good-hearted and relished her role as a trainer.
A writer for Network Ten's "Neighbours" website described Sonya has having a shady past and wanting to set up a new life for herself in Erinsborough.
Sonya used to have alcohol, drug and gambling addictions, but she has worked hard to overcome them.
Morey told a reporter from Channel 5 that she is similar to Sonya morally and ethically, plus they both want the best for the people they love.
However, Sonya occasionally goes about things in a way in which Morey said she did not understand.
The actress also struggled to understand the place of darkness that Sonya has been in too.
When asked if her character could ever escape her past, Morey replied "I don't think she will every truly escape her past because ultimately I don't think she should.
If she doesn't have it there as a reminder and a good motivator to help her stay on track."
Morey revealed she would like to see Sonya reach her potential as a mother in the future.
In an interview with a "What's on TV" journalist, Morey said viewers relate to Sonya because she is "pretty normal".
The actress noted that Sonya is not glamorous and there is "something quite humbling about her."
Morey went on to say that Sonya's heart is usually in the right place and she always tries to do the right thing for the right reasons.
Of her character's development, Morey explained "She has become a lot more self-assured and she has learnt to trust herself again.
I think when we first met her, she was quite closed off and didn't want to let anyone in fear of hurting them."
Sonya decides to give up her job as a guide dog trainer to buy and turn the community garden into a garden nursery.
Morey told Jason Herbison from "Inside Soap" that she thought that the garden was symbolic of what Sonya is doing in her personal life.
She explained "She made a lot of mistakes when she was younger.
Now she just wants to plant beautiful things and watch them grow.
She's very focused on that for now."
==========
When Sonya is sent to check up on the progress of Toadfish Rebecchi's (Ryan Moloney) guide dog puppy, Rocky, she "soon found love" with the lawyer.
Sonya and Toadie began a relationship and Moloney thought that Sonya was perfect for Toadie.
Moloney quipped "She's funny and a little bit zany and really accepting and loving as well."
However, their romance comes to an end when Toadie tells Sonya that he has got back together with his ex-girlfriend, Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner).
A "Sunday Mail" reporter said Sonya was "simply heartbroken" and "devastated" after she was told about Toadie and Steph's relationship.
However, she is unaware that Toadie is pretending to be in love with Steph to help cover up the fact she is carrying Daniel Fitzgerald's (Brett Tucker) child.
Toadie becomes torn when Sonya tells him she loves him, but he carries on the lie.
Of the situation, Moloney said "Toadie is in love with Sonya, but he's had to give up the chance to follow his heart.
Now we see that he really wants nothing more than to be able to tell her he loves her and that he wants to be with her – but he just can't."
Toadie realises that Sonya still loves him when he notices she is still wearing the bracelet he gave her.
Sonya tells him that she is not ready to take it off.
Sonya tries to move forward with her life and starts dating David Foster (Ben Ridgwell).
However, she is struggles with her feelings for Toadie.
Morey told "TV Week" that Sonya is "completely in love with Toadie, but she's trying to move on as best she can – and that's where David comes into the picture."
Despite only being with David for three weeks, Sonya agrees to move to Perth with him.
Morey said that Sonya believes she has nothing left keeping her in Erinsborough and she wants a change of scenery.
Sonya chooses not to tell Toadie that she leaving, so Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major) tells him instead.
Steph then comes by and tells Sonya that Toadie still loves her and that their relationship is sham.
Steph asks Sonya to stay if she wants more information and Steph later tells her that the baby is not Toadie's.
Sonya is left shocked and relieved at the same time.
Sonya agrees to wait for Toadie.
When Steph's secret is eventually revealed, Sonya and Toadie start their relationship over.
Morey told Herbison that due to how the relationship between Sonya and Toadie developed, it gave them a sense of history when they did finally get together.
Morey revealed that she would like to see Sonya and Toadie have children together in the future.
She told a Press Association reporter, "I would love it.
I think there is so much richness in Toadie and Sonya going on that journey together which lends itself to humour, sadness, more drama.
Cross fingers they will go down that path."
Morey also hoped Sonya could be happy in the future.
Morey told the official UK "Neighbours" website in July 2011 that Sonya and Toadie would start to have some excitement and fun again following all the drama, but they would have to deal with a few issues first.
When the subject of marriage comes up, Sonya and Toadie realise that they have different views about it.
Morey explained, "At this point Sonya wants to get married for the wrong reasons, and Toadie doesn't want to get married for the wrong reasons.
They haven't both independently reached a healthy perspective on it.
She wants to do it for security to protect Callum, and he doesn’t want to do it...
He feels it will jinx [their relationship], because his other marriages have gone that way."
Morey added that Sonya and Toadie have reached a point in their relationship where they have to make some big decisions, which could change the direction they move in.
In January 2012, Moloney told Sue Yeap from "The West Australian" that while Sonya was the one for Toadie, he did not think they would not be getting married anytime soon.
The actor believed Toadie did not need a piece of paper and a ring to tell the world that Sonya was "the love of his life."
Sonya and Toadie begin planning to have a baby and Morey stated that she was "deliriously broody" at the prospect of her character becoming pregnant.
She admitted that she loved the journey the couple had been on as they try to start a family, although she thought Sonya might go over the top with the situation, which would make it hard for those around her.
She also believed that Sonya and Toadie would make "wonderful parents" because of the amount of thought they had put into the decision.
She added that Toadie has always wanted a child of his own, while Sonya wanted to make up for her past problems.
After failing to fall pregnant, Sonya gave up hope that she and Toadie would naturally conceive a child and she went through a "mourning process", before trying to move on.
During a blood drive, Sonya was asked to take a pregnancy test and it came back positive.
Both Sonya and Toadie were shocked, but delighted to learn that they were expecting a baby.
A few months later, Toadie asked Sonya to marry him.
He had initially been reluctant to propose, as he had had bad luck with weddings in the past.
Moloney commented to an "Inside Soap" columnist, "He's scared that marriage will change things between him and Sonya, as they're perfect at the moment."
Toadie realised that with a baby on the way, he could not waste time and proposed to Sonya at the nursery.
Sonya, who was "excited, but also a little bit shocked" accepted straight away.
==========
In late 2010, Sonya's younger sister, Jade (Gemma Pranita) was introduced to the serial.
A reporter from the "Herald Sun" stated that Jade's arrival would see her expose "a dark secret" held by Sonya.
Before Jade arrived in Erinsborough, she and Sonya had been estranged from each other for seven years.
Jade contacts Sonya out of the blue, leaving her "mortified" by the call.
Pranita told Jackie Brygel from "TV Week", "Sonya's response is 'Why are you calling me?
Why now?
Don't come anywhere near me!'
But Jade keeps ringing and harassing Sonya and then rocks up on her doorstep."
Pranita explained that Jade and Sonya share a bad history and that Jade has been holding on to one of Sonya's darkest secrets, which the people in Sonya's life know nothing about.
The actress thought that Jade's appearance would "completely rock the boat", especially as she has the potential to cause trouble for her sister and expose her for lying to everyone.
During an interview with a Channel 5 journalist, Morey revealed that the last time the siblings saw each other, they were at their grandmother Hilda's (Maureen Edwards) home and Sonya was in "a very bad place".
This causes Sonya to think that Jade might be in town to get some form of revenge.
The sister's relationship is initially "rocky" and Sonya tries to get rid of Jade, before she can meet Toadie and his son, Callum.
However, she runs out of time and Jade quickly realises that Callum is actually the child Sonya gave up to be raised by their grandmother.
Jade demands an explanation and then urges her sister to tell the truth.
However, after Jade sees how happy Sonya is, she becomes "fiercely supportive" of her.
Pranita noted "It's almost the Mitchell sisters against Ramsay Street."
Morey told Jason Herbison that she could not have asked for a better pretend sister in Pranita, adding that they had become good friends off-screen.
Jade's reappearance in Sonya's life precipitated the revelation that Sonya is Callum's biological mother.
Morey admitted that she was "shocked" and "stunned" when the producers told her about the development for her character.
She questioned how the storyline would come together, since there had never been any indication that Sonya was Callum's mother before.
Morey explained "Initially, I thought, 'How could this work – Sonya being Callum's mum?
', but then I realised it does work.
All of a sudden, it creates even more depth and complexity to Sonya and the decisions she's made and her motivations for things like forgiving Toadie for his and Steph's sham marriage.
There's this whole other layer."
Morey called the storyline "phenomenal" and noted that it would change everything that viewers thought they knew about why Sonya became part of Toadie and Callum's lives.
Morey researched how other people had reacted to similar situations and came to realise that the pieces fall into place, despite it being "a leap."
She stated that Sonya had entered Callum's life, not to get him back, but to see if he was okay.
However, she then fell in love with Toadie.
The actress believed that it was not Sonya's intention to "plant herself in their lives", but it just happened.
When she was asked how Callum does not remember Sonya, Morey explained that Sonya had fallen in with a bad crowd, was an alcohol and drugs addict and was suffering from post-natal depression.
She chose to leave Callum with her grandmother, Hilda, so she could get herself cleaned up.
Hilda then had everything related to Sonya removed from the family.
Callum was around four or five when Sonya left and Morey believed that he had blocked out the bad memories of her.
Morey commented that Sonya's relationship with Callum would have been "a love-hate one" because she was only 16 when she had him.
He would have become like a younger brother to her rather than a son.
Executive producer Susan Bower defended the storyline when asked why Sonya and Callum's history had been rewritten.
She told an "Inside Soap" columnist that they worked with the character's established backgrounds and found reasons and motivations for Sonya to act the way she did.
Bower admitted that the only discrepancy that could be pointed out was Callum's age.
When Hilda dies, Sonya becomes concerned that her secret will be revealed when Callum attends the funeral.
However, Callum chooses to say goodbye to his great-grandmother privately, much to Sonya's relief.
Callum then explains that he wants to find his real mother and tell her that he hates her, which devastates Sonya.
She tells her sister that she cannot tell him the truth now as she cannot handle him looking at her, knowing what she did.
Callum steps up his investigation into the identity of his mother and is injured in an accident while looking for clues.
At the hospital, he recalls a memory about his mother and realises that she is Sonya.
Toadie then "angrily orders" Sonya to leave.
Of the revelation, Morey said "For Toadie, it's a betrayal to both him and his son.
He's angry, but his initial priority is to make Callum number one."
Morey quipped that filming the scenes was "exhausting."
The actress also explained that Toadie's reaction to finding out that Sonya is Callum's real mother was one of devastation, he has to question whether Sonya ever loved him or was only with him to get Callum.
Morey told a writer for "What's on TV" that it had been "fun" to see Sonya change when she could finally be a mother to Callum.
She added that Sonya would probably struggle with everything that happened with Callum, but she should remember that she has been forgiven.
==========
A year after their wedding, Sonya and Toadie's marriage came under strain.
Toadie accused Sonya of neglecting their relationship, when she began to get involved in their friends' problems.
Morey said, "Sonya and Toadie have been together for five years and, unfortunately, little things are starting to niggle - which doesn't mean they're over, or anything like that, but it's definitely causing a few issues for them."
Morey explained that life had slowed down for Sonya and Toadie and they were getting into "the nitty gritty" of their marriage, which was challenging for them both.
Things became worse for Sonya and Toadie when Jacob Holmes (Clayton Watson) kissed Sonya.
Morey told Kirsty Nutkins from the "Daily Express", "The kiss with Jacob was the first big crack in their relationship.
Even though Sonya didn't have feelings for him, it hurt Toadie a lot."
The actress said it was uncomfortable to play out the scenes involving her character's marital problems.
She also found it frustrating, as she knew Sonya in particular was not learning from her mistakes.
Morey thought Sonya and Toadie could benefit from better communication, and from Sonya telling people to seek help from other sources, like a counsellor.
She also thought Toadie could help his wife out more often, especially if the person she was helping was his friend too.
Shortly after Naomi Canning (Morgana O'Reilly) was introduced, it was revealed that she would set her sights on Toadie.
Morey doubted Toadie would have an affair, as it was not in his nature.
She also said Sonya questions certain things that Naomi does, but then lets them go when she is proved wrong.
Morey commented that Sonya and Toadie's relationship was vulnerable to Naomi.
Morey told a "What's on TV" writer that Naomi undermines the things Sonya does, making "small wounds into big gaping bloody cuts."
The actress added that she enjoyed working with O'Reilly, but their characters would never be friends as they were complete opposites.
Sonya later learned that Naomi had kissed Toadie, and she was angry with her for lying and trying to undermine her marriage.
When Naomi and Sonya came face-to-face, Naomi provoked Sonya by blaming her for the troubles in her marriage, causing Sonya to "impulsively" slap Naomi.
Morey admitted that she was uncomfortable about having to slap O'Reilly, as they are friends in real life.
Sonya later apologised to Naomi, but told her to stay away from her family.
Morey called it a "pretty satisfying" moment.
==========
In October 2014, it was announced that Sonya would become the focus of a hate mail campaign storyline.

He initially kept the letter from Sonya, deciding that he would investigate on his own.

When Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) also received a letter about Sonya, Toadie then told Sonya the truth leaving her "horrified" and fearing for her safety.
Sonya's paranoia about the situation caused her to forgo her plans to take Nell trick-or-treating for Halloween and leave a GA meeting abruptly.
When Patricia Pappas (Katerina Kotsonis) berated Toadie for his involvement in her son's court case, Brennan suspected Patricia could be the letter sender, but she too was ruled out.
Shortly after, Sonya was falsely accused of child abuse when Nell had a fall at the park, while Sonya looked away for a brief moment.
Sonya was then visited by a Department of Human Services worker after a formal complaint was made against her.
The situation made Sonya realise that she was being watched by the same person who sent the letters.
Sonya's stalker was revealed to be her old school friend Erin Rogers (Adrienne Pickering).
Erin broke into Sonya's home and admitted to sending the letters because she blamed Sonya for introducing her to drugs, which ruined her life.
Morey commented, "Erin represents what could have happened to Sonya if she didn't get out of that life."
After Erin was arrested, Toadie warned her to stay away from his family, while Sonya felt so guilty she paid Erin's bail.
Sonya then vowed to make amends with Erin and helped her get a job at The Waterhole, but after Brennan exposed Erin as Sonya's stalker, she lost the job leaving Sonya "to pick up the pieces once again".
On Christmas Day, Sonya began thinking about how Erin would be spending the holiday, which prompted Brennan to find her the address of Erin's squat.
Sonya visited Erin with some food, but Erin told her to leave as she did not need her charity.
Sonya then made it clear that she would be there for Erin when she needed her.
