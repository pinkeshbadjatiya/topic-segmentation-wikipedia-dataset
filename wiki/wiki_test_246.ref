Timeline of De Vito on the series:
==========
After recovery from her throat nodules, Cosima De Vito was unable to negotiate a suitable record deal and funded her own label, (CDV Records) with the financial help of her family.
Her managers, Constantine Nellis and Ted Gardner, "took on the singer after she was widely shunned by local record companies".
For her independent album, "Cosima", she flew to Los Angeles to have ten of its eleven tracks penned by Diane Warren (Celine Dion, Christina Aguilera, and Aerosmith) who commented "When I heard her sing I was blown away ... Cosima is a younger, edgier Celine Dion".
On 9 August 2004 Cosima's first single, the double A-sided, "When the War Is Over" / "One Night Without You", was released.
"When the War Is Over" is a cover of a Cold Chisel ballad and "One Night Without Your" was one of Warren's tracks.
It debuted at No.
1 in the ARIA Singles Chart ahead of fellow "Australian Idol" Paulini's "Angel Eyes" and Australian singer-songwriter, Missy Higgins' "Scar" (both had reached No.
1 earlier).
The single was certified platinum by ARIA for shipment of 70,000 units by December 2004.
An alternate version of the song, with production similar to her live idol performance, was recorded before working with Diane Warren.
This version was not released as the overall sound was different from the rest of the album and so a new version (which was later released as the single) was recorded.
On 11 October 2004 her self-titled debut album, "Cosima", was released.
It debut at No.
2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No.
1 on the Independent charts.

In May that year De Vito was invited to perform at the 30th Anniversary Gala Dinner for then-Prime Minister, John Howard.

There were distribution problems and lack of radio airplay.
On 23 December, De Vito parted ways with her management team, Nellis and Gardner, who had guided her since the end of "Australian Idol".
The parties were in dispute over A$500,000, that her managers alleged they were owed.
A third single, "Cost of Love" was in the works, with video clip ideas being drawn up.
De Vito had extra production work done on the album version – more guitar, heavier drums and re-recorded vocals.
Due to legal battles with her previous management, the third single was dropped.
