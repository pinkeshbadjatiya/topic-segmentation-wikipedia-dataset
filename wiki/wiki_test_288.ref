Natural areas of England
The natural areas of England are regions, each with a characteristic association of wildlife and natural features.
More formally, they are defined as "biogeographic zones which reflect the geological foundation, the natural systems and processes and the wildlife in different parts of England...".
There are 120 natural areas in England ranging from the North Pennines to the Dorset Heaths and from The Lizard to The Fens.
They were first defined in 1996 by English Nature and the Countryside Commission, with help from English Heritage.
They produced a map of England that depicts the natural and cultural dimensions of the landscape.
Natural areas are assessed by Natural England, the UK Government's advisor on the natural environment, to be "a sensible scale at which to view the wildlife resource, from both a national and local perspective".
Natural Areas were also used by English Nature as an "ecologically coherent framework for setting objectives for nature conservation."
Many natural areas coincide with a further natural division referred to as national character areas; however, in other cases a natural area may contain two or more character areas.
