The Authority (professional wrestling)
The Authority was a villainous professional wrestling stable in WWE, which originated due to Triple H helping Randy Orton to win the WWE Championship from Daniel Bryan at the 2013 SummerSlam pay-per-view.
The stable was led by company executives Triple H and Stephanie McMahon, and many other wrestlers were a part of the group, most notably Seth Rollins as "The Man" until suffering a knee injury in November 2015, Kane as the "Director of Operations" until October 2015 and Randy Orton as The Authority's hand-picked champion and "Face of the WWE" until November 2014.
The Shield formerly acted as The Authority's main henchmen to offer protection or carry out attacks until March 2014.
The name of "The Authority" was introduced in October 2013 and initially referred to only Triple H and Stephanie McMahon as a power couple.
The Authority shared similarities with The Corporation and The McMahon-Helmsley Faction, and has also had ties to Triple H's previous stables D-Generation X and Evolution.
The stable's run ended after WrestleMania 32 when Triple H was dethroned as WWE World Heavyweight Champion by Roman Reigns, and Shane McMahon received authority to run "Raw".
==========
From June 2013, members of the McMahon family began to dispute various elements of the control of WWE, such as the fates of Daniel Bryan, and of "Raw" and "SmackDown" General Managers Brad Maddox and Vickie Guerrero.
On the July 15 episode of "Raw", John Cena chose Bryan as his opponent for his WWE Championship defence at SummerSlam.

The following night on "Raw", Orton would have a championship coronation along with Mr. McMahon, Stephanie McMahon and Triple H, with Triple H inviting Bryan to the ring to clear the air from the night before.

That same night, The Shield would begin to work for Triple H as his enforcers.
Kane would also join The Authority as the "Director of Operations".
During this time, The Authority were also feuding with Big Show, who as well as Bryan, was voicing his displeasure of Triple H's regime.

At the pay-per-view, Orton would go on to successfully retain his title.
The Authority were also involved in a short feud with Cody Rhodes, after Rhodes also spoke out against Triple H's authoritarian rule.

Orton agreed to rejoin the stable, and he and Rollins were subsequently booked in a tag team match for later that night against Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.
The loss Orton and Rollins suffered in the match further exacerbated tension between the two.
The tension would finally reach a head a few weeks later when Orton refused a tag from Rollins and left the ring during a match with Roman Reigns, revealing that he only rejoined The Authority to get revenge on Rollins for his curb stomp.
Orton would then brutally beat Rollins for several minutes after the bout, ultimately putting him through an announce table with an "RKO".
At WrestleMania 31, The Authority won several big victories; Triple H defeated Sting in Sting's WWE debut match (shaking his hand afterwards), and Big Show won the 30-man André the Giant Memorial battle royal; after losing in his singles match against Orton earlier in the night, Rollins cashed his Money in the Bank contract during the main event between Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, turning it into a triple threat match, becoming a world champion for the first time and giving The Authority its first world title since Orton lost it in the previous WrestleMania.

On the July 6 episode of "Raw", when Lesnar destroyed J&J Security's Cadillac Escalade given to them by Rollins, both Noble and Mercury were injured by Lesnar in the storyline; this resulted in them being out of action indefinitely.
A week later, during the contract signing for the match on the July 13 episode of "Raw", Rollins and Kane attempted to attack Lesnar, but Lesnar thwarted them by executing a "F-5" to Kane to the floor and later kayfabe injuring Kane's ankle using a steel step.
After Lesnar left, Rollins blamed Kane for the failure of the attack attempt, and further exacerbated his ankle injury by attacking him.

At Night of Champions, however, Rollins learned he had to defend both of this newly won titles in one night.
Cena enacted his rematch clause to regain the United States Championship, while Rollins successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against the returning Sting, who suffered a legitimate neck injury in the match that would force him to retire early the following year.
At the end of the night, Rollins would be attacked by Sheamus, the then Mr. Money in the Bank, followed by a vengeful Demon Kane.
Upon returning to the Authority, Kane began playing mind games with Rollins and the Authority members, acting completely ignorant as to his actions at Night of Champions.
He then ambushed and attacked Rollins on several occasions as Demon Kane, causing the Authority to grant Kane a World Heavyweight Championship title match at Hell in a Cell, in which both Rollins' title and Kane's job as Director of Operations were at stake.
Rollins retained the title and Kane was removed permanently from the Authority.

At Survivor Series, Sheamus cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated newly crowned champion Roman Reigns, after he refused to shake hands with Triple H, to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, thus aligning with Triple H and The Authority.

After the match, Reigns "snapped" following his loss and attacked Sheamus, Alberto Del Rio and Rusev.
Triple H came to the ring to calm Reigns down and tend to Sheamus, but as he did so Reigns attacks him as well that left him injured and out of action in the storyline.
Following Reigns's attack on Triple H, Mr. McMahon took temporary leadership of The Authority in Triple H's absence and gave Reigns a title match on Sheamus's request on the December 14 episode of "Raw", but gave the stipulation that should Reigns fail to win the title, he would be fired (kayfabe).
