Pennsylvania Route 641
Pennsylvania Route 641 (PA 641) is a state route located in Central Pennsylvania in the United States.
The route is long and runs from U.S. Route 522 (US 522) near Shade Gap east to US 11/US 15 in Camp Hill.
PA 641 heads east from Shade Gap in Huntingdon County and immediately crosses PA 35 before it heads across Tuscarora Mountain into Franklin County.
The route intersects PA 75 in Spring Run before it crosses Kittatinny and Blue mountains and reaches a junction with PA 997 in Roxbury.
PA 641 heads into the agricultural Cumberland Valley and enters Cumberland County, where it intersects PA 696 in Newburg and PA 233 in Newville before reaching Carlisle.
In Carlisle, the route runs concurrent with US 11 and PA 74 on High Street and crosses PA 34 in the center of town.
East of here, PA 641 has an interchange with Interstate 81 (I-81) and heads to Mechanicsburg, where it intersects PA 114.
The route continues through the western suburbs of Harrisburg and has an interchange with US 11/PA 581 before ending in Camp Hill.
PA 641 has a truck route, PA 641 Truck, that bypasses the winding stretch across Kittatinny Mountain.
PA 641 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 74 in Carlisle east to US 11 (Carlisle Pike) in Camp Hill.
The same year, the road between Shade Gap and east of Spring Run and for a short distance to the west of Roxbury became part of PA 433 while PA 333 was designated onto the road between Roxbury and Newburg.
In 1937, PA 641 was extended west to PA 433 east of Spring Run, replacing the portion of PA 333 between Roxbury and Newburg and running concurrent with PA 433 for a short distance to the west of Roxbury.
The east end was moved to its current location at US 15 in the 1950s, with a realigned US 15 replacing the section of PA 641 north on 32nd Street to Carlisle Pike.
In the 1960s, PA 641 was extended west to Shade Gap, replacing that stretch of PA 433 while the PA 433 designation was also removed from the road to the west of Roxbury.

==========
When Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 641 was designated as part of Legislative Route 121 between Shade Gap and Spring Run and as part of Legislative Route 264 between Spring Run and Roxbury.
At this time, the current alignment of the route between Carlisle and Camp Hill was a paved road.
PA 641 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 74 in Carlisle east to US 11 (Carlisle Pike) in Camp Hill, following its current alignment east before turning north on 32nd Street to US 11.
The same year, PA 433 was designated onto the road between US 522 in Shade Gap and Amberson Road and between Cold Spring Road and Roxbury while PA 333 was designated onto the road between Roxbury and Newburg, both these sections of PA 433 and PA 333 were unpaved.
The road between Newburg and Carlisle was an unnumbered road that was unpaved between Newburg and Green Spring and paved between Green Spring and Carlisle.
In 1937, PA 641 was extended west from Carlisle to PA 433 at the intersection of Amberson Road and Timmons Road, following its current alignment.
The route ran concurrent with PA 433 between Roxbury and Cold Spring Road.
The extended PA 641 designation replaced PA 333 between Roxbury and Newburg.
The entire length of PA 641 was paved in the 1930s along with the section of PA 433 between Shade Gap and the western terminus of PA 641.
The eastern terminus of PA 641 was moved to its present location at US 15 in the 1950s, with a rerouted US 15 replacing the route along 32nd Street.
In the 1960s, PA 641 was extended west to its current terminus at US 522 in Shade Gap, replacing the section of PA 433 between Shade Gap and Amberson Road.
In addition, the concurrent PA 433 designation was removed from PA 641 between Cold Spring Road and Roxbury.
