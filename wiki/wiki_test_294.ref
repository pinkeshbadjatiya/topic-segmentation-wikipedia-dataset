After the auditions, the actual format of the show will begin.
The show involves various "tasks" which are generally mentally and physically difficult.
As the show progresses, the "tasks" become harder for the contestants to complete.
There are 3 types of tasks: Money Tasks, Immunity Tasks & Advantage Tasks.
At the end of each episode, the contestants vote one contestant out of the show, however it is seen in previous seasons of the show that a previous contestant may return to the show after being voted out.
The show's mastermind is Raghu Ram who is well known for adding twists and turns to the journey and making survival in the show very difficult and generate a lot of fights and gives the show a bad name for its murky politics & abuses exchanged.
