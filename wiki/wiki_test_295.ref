In the mid-1990s, BrownHouse Productions, run by Whitney Houston and Debra Martin Chase (One of the producers of the film) secured the rights to a "Sparkle" remake from Warner Bros. Houston had intended to cast R&B singer Aaliyah in the lead role as Sparkle, but due to Aaliyah's untimely death in August 2001, before the film went into production plans to remake the film was put on hold.
In 2005, it was revealed Raven-Symoné was cast in the leading role.
Following the 2011 release of their first feature, "Jumping the Broom", Salim Akil and Mara Brock Akil, the creative team behind the TV series "The Game" and Girlfriends, took on "Sparkle" as their next project, with Houston executive producing and starring as the mother of the three girls.
Production for the film began on October 10, 2011 in Detroit.
Filming wrapped up in early November 2011, with a release date scheduled for August 17, 2012.
The official trailer for "Sparkle" was released on April 2, 2012 and premiered on "Today" with the release of the trailer the films producer Debra Martin Chase said she had mixed emotions with the trailer's release "On the one hand, I'm so excited about the movie and we're really happy with how it turned out," she said.
"(But) just to have it said yet again that this is Whitney's last performance, it's hard.
It's hard."
Howard Rosenman, the original's producer-writer and executive producer of the 2012 version of "Sparkle", said a novelization of the movie will be released on August 7, 2012 by Simon & Schuster.
Rosenman said Houston was influenced by the original movie as a girl and once went to see it every day for a week when she was a teenager.
It apparently helped plant the dream in her to become a singer.
When the new version was coming together, Rosenman approached her to play the girls' mother.
She has two musical numbers in the film and on the soundtrack.
Rosenman plans to team with director Joel Schumacher, one of the screenwriters of the original 1976 movie, to add five new songs to those by Curtis Mayfield (in the original) and R. Kelly (in the 2012 version) for a Broadway musical of "Sparkle".

This was later pushed back by a week to August 17, 2012 due to Whitney Houston's death.

The movie got mixed to positive reviews.
Sparkle received an A on Cinemascore.
Critic reviews for "Sparkle" so far have been generally mixed to positive, receiving a 57% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and a consensus stating: "While undeniably melodramatic and old-fashioned, "Sparkle" transcends its formulaic trappings thanks to Salim Akil's empathetic direction and strong performances from a committed cast" based on 63 review with an average rating of 5.7/10.
Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 25 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be "mixed or average reviews".
Critical praise has been particularly been given to Carmen Ejogo's performance.
Film critic Roger Ebert of "The Chicago Sun-Times" awarded the film 3 stars, claiming Ejojo "steals the film not only in her sultry singing numbers but in her violent marriage to a snaky, evil comedian named Satin."
While giving the film a negative review, "The Globe and Mail" critic Courtney Shea stated Ejogo, in comparison to Sparks' performance, was "in fact more dynamic, sexy and, dare we say, Bootylicious than the real thing – plays hardened vulnerability to perfection, so much so that you wonder (given her 38 years) where Hollywood has been hiding her."
Mick LaSalle of the "San Francisco Chronicle" went as far as to suggest in his review that Ejogo's performance might place her under serious consideration for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.
LaSalle comments: "...very few people will walk out of "Sparkle" talking about either Sparks or Houston, at least not at first.
Instead they will be saying, "Who was that?"
And they'll be referring to Carmen Ejogo...If there is any justice, Ejogo will become very famous very soon.
As in, maybe today...It's rare to see someone become a movie star right before your eyes, but that's what happens with Ejogo in "Sparkle.
"...For an actress, this was the opportunity of a lifetime, and Ejogo plays it that way.
She leaves nothing out, holds nothing back."
