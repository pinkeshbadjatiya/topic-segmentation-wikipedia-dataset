Chess handicap
A handicap (or "odds") in chess is a way to enable a weaker player to have a chance of winning against a stronger one.
There are a variety of such handicaps, such as material odds (the stronger player surrenders a certain piece or pieces), extra moves (the weaker player has an agreed number of moves at the beginning of the game), extra time on the chess clock, and special conditions (such as requiring the odds-giver to deliver checkmate with a specified piece or pawn).
Various permutations of these, such as "pawn and two moves", are also possible.
Handicaps were quite popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, when chess was often played for money stakes, in order to induce weaker players to play for wagers.
Today, except for time odds, handicaps are rarely seen.
Rybka, however, a top-rated computer chess engine, played a successful series of handicap matches in 2007 and 2008 against human chess masters.
Some new chess websites offer handicap options to their users.
This is an increasingly popular and entertaining game format because it helps bridge the large chess-strength disparity frequently found in online play.
==========
According to Harry Golombek, "Odds-giving reached its heyday in the eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century."
Indeed, it was so prevalent in the 18th century that Philidor (1726–1795) played the vast majority of his games at odds.
About fifteen percent of the known games of Paul Morphy (1837–1884) are games in which he gave odds.
Howard Staunton in "The Chess-Player's Handbook" (1847) advised inexperienced players to accept odds offered by superior players and, upon improving to the point that they can themselves give odds to some players, to avoid playing such players on even terms, warning that doing so is apt to induce "an indolent, neglectful habit of play".
In 1849, Staunton published "The Chess-Player's Companion", a 510-page work "chiefly directed to the exposition of openings where one party gives odds".
Just over 300 pages were devoted to odds games: Book I (pages 1 to 185) contained games played at various odds, and most of Book V (pages 380–496) discussed various types of odds, including exotic and unusual ones.
The late-19th century chess opening treatise "Chess Openings Ancient and Modern", by Edward Freeborough and Charles Ranken, included fourteen pages of analysis of best play in games played at odds of pawn and move, pawn and two moves, and either knight.
Macon Shibut writes that in the mid-19th century "chess was a gambling game ... .
Individual matches for stakes were the focus of organized play.
Matches between leading players attracted a wide following so masters often succeeded in finding sponsors to back their personal wagers."
However, the available sums were generally relatively meager, and travel was arduous, so the amount of money obtained in this way was not sufficient to enable professional chess players to support themselves financially.
Moreover, the first major chess tournament was not organized until 1851, and chess tournaments remained a rarity for several decades following.
With tournaments an unreliable means of making a living, odds-giving became a way for masters to entice amateurs into playing for wagers, since the odds gave the amateur a fighting chance.
The odds system even became the earliest rating system: amateurs were graded according to what handicap they needed to compete against a master, and were referred to as a "Rook player" or "Pawn and move player", for example, as we would today speak of players by their Elo ratings (e.g.
a "1200 player" or an "1800 player").
The playing of games at odds gradually grew rarer as the nineteenth century proceeded.
Today, except for time odds, they have all but disappeared.
Shibut posits that games played at material odds became unpopular for (1) technological, (2) political, and (3) philosophical reasons.
Taking these in turn, first, the introduction of chess clocks gave rise to a new way to give odds, one that has today supplanted material odds as the preferred mode of odds-giving.
Second, the Soviet Union supported chess masters and sponsored chess education, but expected chess masters "to be cultural icons, not hustlers".
Third, chess began to be treated in a scientific, logical way, "with an assumption of idealized 'best play' [coming] to underpin all analysis".
From this perspective, a game beginning from a "lost" position becomes less interesting, even distasteful.
Writings by Wilhelm Steinitz (1836–1900), the first World Champion, and James Mason (1849–1905) are consistent with the last point.
In an interview with Ralph Ginzburg published in the January 1962 issue of "Harper's Magazine", future World Champion Bobby Fischer was quoted as saying that women were weak chessplayers and that he could successfully give knight odds to any woman in the world.
Fischer later claimed that Ginzburg had distorted what he had said.
In 2001, London businessman Terence Chapman, a master-level player, played a match against former World Champion Garry Kasparov, with Kasparov giving odds of two pawns in each game (the pawns removed were different each time); Kasparov won the match by two games to one, with one draw.
Rybka, a top-rated computer chess engine designed by International Master Vasik Rajlich, played a series of handicap matches against strong human players.
In March 2007, Rybka defeated Grandmaster Jaan Ehlvest after giving pawn odds (removing a different pawn each time).
In January 2008, Rybka defeated Grandmaster Joel Benjamin after giving draw odds.
On March 2008, Rybka gave pawn and move (removing a different pawn each time) to Grandmaster Roman Dzindzichashvili, drawing the match 4–4.
In June 2008, Rybka gave knight odds to FIDE Master John Meyer, losing 4–0.
On July 6, 2008, Rybka gave Meyer odds of pawn and three moves, winning 3–1.
==========
The purpose of a handicap, or odds, is to compensate for the difference in skill between two chess players.
There are a variety of handicaps: material odds; extra moves; time odds; special restrictions (such as pion coiffé); weighting of results (such as "draw odds" – counting a draw as a loss for the odds-giver); differential stakes; and physical restrictions, such as blindfold chess.
Many different permutations of handicaps (for example, a material handicap plus time odds) are also possible, as are countervailing handicaps (for example, a player gives up a piece, but receives one of the opponent's pieces or pawns and/or extra moves, in return).
==========
Harry Golombek gives the following list of material odds (in increasing handicap level):
Note that the odds-giver plays White unless otherwise indicated, and "pawn odds" normally refers to the f-pawn (i.e.
the pawn initially located on the f2-square for White, and on the f7-square for Black).
Larry Kaufman writes that under the chess tradition of the 18th and 19th centuries, the handicap below knight odds was:
Even with the "no moves beyond the fourth rank" proviso, Black cannot give White an unlimited number of moves.
Doing so would allow White to set up the position at right, when White's dual threats of 1.Qxf7# and 1.Ned6+ cxd6 2.Nxd6# are immediately decisive.
I.A.
Horowitz adds to the above list the following:
If a rook is given, the player giving the odds can still castle with the absent rook, moving only the king.
==========
Time handicaps are most often practiced in blitz games.
The stronger player may be given one or two minutes to play the whole game, while the weaker player receives five minutes or more.
Money odds are another way of compensating for a difference in strength; the stronger player puts up some multiple (three, five, ten, etc.)
of the amount of money put up by the weaker player.
In the 16th–19th centuries pion coiffé (capped or marked pawn) handicapping was sometimes used.
The stronger player must checkmate with a particular pawn, which is usually marked at the start of play.
The pawn cannot be promoted; giving checkmate with any other pawn or piece loses the game.
Pion coiffé is considered to be about equivalent to giving odds of a queen.
Similarly, games have occasionally been played with a ringed piece, where a ring or band is placed around a particular piece, and the player giving odds must checkmate with that piece.
This form of odds, along with pion coiffé, are very difficult for the odds-giver, who cannot allow the odds-receiver to sacrifice for the capped or ringed piece or pawn.
For instance, in pion coiffé, after 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5, Black already threatens to sacrifice the queen for the capped pawn if it is the a-, d-, or g-pawn, to play 3...Qe5+ followed by such a sacrifice if it is the b- or h-pawn, or to play 3...Qe4+ followed by a sacrifice if it is the c-pawn.
Staunton also mentioned the following unusual forms of odds not discussed by Carrera:
==========
Grandmaster Larry Kaufman wrote the following about the Elo rating equivalence of giving knight odds:
[T]he Elo equivalent of a given handicap degrades as you go down the scale.
A knight seems to be worth around a thousand points when the "weak" player is around IM level, but it drops as you go down.
For example, I'm about 2400 and I've played tons of knight odds games with students, and I would put the break-even point (for untimed but reasonably quick games) with me at around 1800, so maybe a 600 value at this level.
An 1800 can probably give knight odds to a 1400, a 1400 to an 1100, an 1100 to a 900, etc.
This is pretty obviously the way it must work, because the weaker the players are, the more likely the weaker one is to blunder a piece or more.
When you get down to the level of the average 8 year old player, knight odds is just a slight edge, maybe 50 points or so.
Kaufman has written that Kasparov could give pawn and move odds to a low grandmaster (2500 FIDE rating) and be slightly favored, and would have even chances at knight odds against a player with a FIDE rating of 2115.
