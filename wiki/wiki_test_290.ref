National Character Area
A National Character Area (NCA) is a natural subdivision of England based on a combination of landscape, biodiversity, geodiversity and economic activity.
There are 159 National Character Areas and they follow natural, rather than administrative, boundaries.
They are defined by Natural England, the UK government's advisors on the natural environment.
==========
As part of its responsibilities in delivering the Natural Environment White Paper, Biodiversity 2020 and the European Landscape Convention, Natural England is revising its National Character Area profiles to make environmental evidence and information easily available to a wider audience.
Revised profiles for all 159 NCAs are due to be published by April 2014.
The new NCAs are being published in a rolling program and can be found on the Natural England website.
NCAs are areas that share similar landscape characteristics, and which follow natural lines in the landscape rather than administrative boundaries, making them a good decision-making framework for the natural environment.
National Character Area profiles are guidance documents which can help communities to inform their decision-making about the places that they live in and care for.
The information they contain will support the planning of conservation initiatives at a landscape scale, inform the delivery of nature improvement areas and encourage broader partnership working through local nature partnerships.
The profiles will also help to inform choices about how land is managed and can change.
Each profile includes a description of the natural and cultural features that shape our landscapes, how the landscape has changed over time, the current key drivers for ongoing change, and a broad analysis of each areaâ€™s characteristics and ecosystem services.
Statements of environmental opportunity (SEOs) are suggested, which draw on this integrated information.
The SEOs offer guidance on the critical issues, which could help to achieve sustainable growth and a more secure environmental future.
NCA profiles are working documents which draw on current evidence and knowledge.
Natural England aim to refresh and update them periodically as new information becomes available.
==========
Natural England list the Natural Character Areas by regions.
Because some overlap regional boundaries, they may be shown in more than one region.
