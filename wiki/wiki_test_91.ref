The Steelers made the most of their opportunity, scoring on O'Donnell's 26-yard touchdown completion to Ernie Mills that increased their lead to 17–7 at the end of the half.

In week 17, the Lions defeated Green Bay 30–20, intercepting four passes from quarterback Brett Favre and winning despite playing without their best offensive star, running back Barry Sanders.
The win gave them homefield advantage for this game.
But even though Sanders recovered from his injury in time for the playoffs, this time the Packers won by overcoming a 17–7 third quarter deficit and pulling ahead on Favre's 40-yard game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe with 55 seconds left.
Detroit held the ball for over 10 minutes in the first quarter, but could only score 3 points.
Early in the game, a 25-yard run by Sanders with an additional 15 yards added on by a facemask penalty on LeRoy Butler sparked a drive deep into Green Bay terrority, but it ended with no points when Packers defensive back Terrell Buckley intercepted a pass from Erik Kramer in the end zone.
After forcing a punt, the Lions drove back, mostly on receptions by Brett Perriman, and scored on Jason Hanson's 47-yard field goal on the last play of the first quarter.
Green Bay responded to the field goal with Favre's 12-yard touchdown pass to Sharpe.
Then Green Bay caught a break when their kickoff hit the ground near the sideline, bounced into returner Mel Gray and then bounced out of bounds at the Lions 5-yard line.
But it didn't stop Detroit as they still drove 95 yards, featuring a 44-yard run by Sanders and a 13-yard 3rd down conversion reception by Perriman after the ball bounced off Sanders' hands, and scored on Perriman's one handed 1-yard touchdown reception to take a 10–7 lead at the end of the half.
Midway through the third period, Jim Arnold's punt pinned Green Bay at their own 5-yard line.
Two plays later, Detroit defensive back Melvin Jenkins intercepted a pass from Favre and returned it 15 yards for a touchdown to extend the Lions' lead, 17–7.
But the Packers countered with a 28-yard touchdown pass from Favre to Sharpe.
Then with Detroit deep inside Green Bay territory, Packers safety George Teague intercepted Kramer's pass in the end zone and returned it a playoff record 101 yards to give the Packers a 21–17 lead.
But on their very next drive Lions would regain the lead on running back Derrick Moore's 5-yard touchdown with 8:27 left in the fourth quarter.
Corey Harris' 45-yard kickoff return gave the Packers good field position, but they were unable to take advantage and had to punt after demoralizing third down play in which Favre overthrew wide open receiver Mark Clayton near the end zone.
After forcing a punt, Robert Brooks' 21-yard return gave Green Bay the ball on their own 29-yard line with 2:24 left in regulation.
Favre started off the drive with an 11-yard completion to Edgar Bennett.
His next pass to tight end Ed West moved the ball to midfield, and he followed it up with a completion to Sharpe on the Lions 40-yard line.
On the next play, he took the snap and ran left.
Defensive back Kevin Scott, who was covering Sharpe one on one along the right sideline, slowed down a bit when he saw Favre running, just enough for Sharpe to pull ahead of him and Favre launched a 40-yard pass to Sharpe in the end zone for the game winning score.
Sanders had the best postseason performance of his career, finishing the game with 167 rushing yards.
Perriman caught 10 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown.
Sharpe, who had not practiced in the last 8 weeks due to turf toe (though he was still able to play in games) and had set the NFL single season record for receptions in their week 17 meeting against Detroit, caught five passes for 101 yards and tied a playoff record with 3 touchdown receptions.
This was Scott's last game in the NFL.
This was the final playoff game at the Silverdome as the Lions have not hosted a playoff game since.
This was featured on NFL's Greatest Games as Favre to Sharpe.

A howling, gusting wind dominated the game as both teams could only score a combined 27 points.
However, the Giants managed to score two touchdowns, both by running back Rodney Hampton in the third quarter, to pull ahead for good.
New York had the wind at their back in the first quarter, but could only score on kicker David Treadwell's 26-yard field goal on their opening drive.
In the second quarter, they had another chance to score, but receiver Mark Jackson dropped a pass on 3rd and 2 from the Vikings 17 and then Treadwell drilled a 34-yard field goal attempt wide left.
Meanwhile, the Vikings went up 7-3 on Jim McMahon's 40-yard pass to wide receiver Cris Carter.
Near the end of the half, Giants quarterback Phil Simms threw a 3rd down pass to Dave Meggett that lost 9 yards, bringing up 4th and 19 from the New York 23.
On the next play, punter Mike Horan shanked a kick that went right into the back of teammate Greg Jackson, a blocker in the backfield, enabling the Vikings to take over on the Giants 36 with 29 seconds left in the half and take a 10-3 halftime lead on Fuad Reveiz's franchise postseason record 52-yard field goal.
The Giants had the wind again in the third quarter, and on their first drive of the second half, Hampton scored on a 51-yard rushing touchdown, the longest run in Giants postseason history.
Then Harry Newsome's punt went just 21 yards to the Minnesota 26-yard line.
Hampton subsequently converted a 4th and 1 situation with a 2-yard run and rushed for 5 yards on 3rd and 2 as the team drove to another touchdown on his 2-yard score.
On the extra point attempt, the snap sailed right Horan's hands and went right into the arms of Treadwell.
However, Treadwell managed to run the ball into the end zone for a successful conversion, giving the team a 17-10 lead.
Although the Vikings held the wind advantage again during the final period, the Giants defense managed to shut them down to preserve the victory.
The Vikings had a great chance to tie the game when Carter caught a deep pass from backup quarterback Sean Salisbury and appeared to be on his way to a sure touchdown, but safety Myron Guyton caught up with him from behind and knocked the ball out of his hands.
Jackson recovered it for the Giants on the Vikings 15-yard line to put the game away.
Hampton finished the game with 33 carries for 161 yards and 2 touchdowns, along with 6 receptions for 24 yards.

In one of the coldest games in NFL history, the Bills overcame a 17–13 Raiders lead by scoring three times in a span of 6:18 in the second half.
The Raiders got the first scoring opportunity of the game when quarterback Jeff Hostetler's first pass of the game was complete to Tyrone Montgomery for a 19-yard gain to the Bills 29-yard line.
But a third down sack by Buffalo lineman Bruce Smith halted the drive and Jeff Jaeger missed a field goal attempt from 47 yards.
Buffalo then took over and drove to the Raiders 30-yard line, but also came up empty when Jim Kelly threw an incomplete pass on a 4th and 1 conversion attempt.
After the turnover, Hostetler threw a 36-yard completion to tight end Ethan Horton and a 12-yard completion to Nick Bell on the way to a 30-yard field goal by Jaeger, giving Los Angeles a 3–0 lead early in the second quarter.
But Buffalo quickly stormed back with a huge play from special teams expert Steve Tasker, who snagged Jaeger's short kickoff out of the air while on the run and raced 67 yards to the Raiders 1-yard line before being shoved out of bounds by Willie Gault.
Following an offsides penalty against the Raiders, running back Kenneth Davis' took ball across the goal line on the next play, giving the Bills a 6–3 lead after Steve Christie missed the extra point.

49ers running back Ricky Watters rushed for 118 yards, caught 5 passes for 46 yards, and scored an NFL playoff record 5 touchdowns as San Francisco crushed the Giants, 44–3.
The 49ers racked up 413 yards of offense, with an average of 6.4 yards per play, while holding the Giants to just 194 yards and forcing 3 turnovers.
They also sacked quarterback Phil Simms 4 times.
San Francisco started off the game with an 80-yard drive in which Steve Young completed his first four passes, including a 31-yard completion to John Taylor on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by Watters.
Kicker Mike Cofer missed the extra point, but little else would go wrong for San Francisco for the rest of the game.
Following a Giants punt, San Francisco went up 9-0 on Cofer's 29-yard field goal.
Then linebacker Bill Romanowski deflected a Simms pass into the arms of defensive back Tim McDonald, who returned the ball 4 yards to the Giants 41.
8 plays later, Watters scored another 1-yard touchdown run to give the 49ers a 16-0 lead.
After another New York punt, San Francisco drove 92 yards, featuring a 43-yard reception by Taylor, to score on Watters' third touchdown of the day, this one from two yards out.
New York eventually cut the score to 23-3 at halftime with a 25-yard field goal from kicker David Treadwell after they stopped the 49ers on 4th and 1 on their own 21-yard line, but this would be their only score.
Watters added two more touchdowns in the second half.
He actually had a chance to score a sixth touchdown, but he was taken out of the game early in the fourth quarter with the ball on the Giants 11-yard line.
Instead, he got to sit on the bench as Marc Logan scored the 49ers final points on a 2-yard run.
There was no question who was the best team out there today", said Giants coach Dan Reeves.
"I'm disappointed that we came in and played this way.
It hurts; it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
The 49ers took us out of our element very quickly.
They struck quickly and repeatedly, and took the running game away from us."
Although he didn't throw any touchdown passes, Young was near-perfect in the game, completing 17 of 22 passes for 226 yards, and rushing for 17 yards on the ground.
The game was also notable in that it would end up being the final game in the storied career of New York linebacker Lawrence Taylor, and as it turned out, it would be the final game for Simms as well.

In the third quarter, Green Bay got a chance to come back when safety Terrell Buckley intercepted a pass from Aikman on the Packers 40-yard line.

Dallas then drove 47 yards, including a 27-yard reception by Irvin, to score on Murray's 38-yard field goal and increase their lead to 27–10.
The Packers responded with a drive from their 15 to the Dallas 15, but any hope of a miracle comeback was dashed on the 13th play when safety Darren Woodson ended the drive with an interception.
In the last two minutes of the game, Green Bay scored on Favre's 29-yard touchdown throw to Sharpe, but by then the game was well out of reach.
Favre finished the game with 331 passing yards, just 1 yard short of a Packers playoff record, and two touchdowns, but was picked off twice.
His top target was Sharpe, who caught 6 passes for 128 yards.
Aikman completed 28 of 37 passes for 302 yards, 3 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions, while Irvin recorded 9 receptions for 126 yards.

Chiefs quarterback Joe Montana threw three touchdown passes in the second half to give his team a 28–20 win and put an end to Houston's 11-game winning streak, while Kansas City's defense terrorized Houston quarterback Warren Moon, forcing three turnovers and sacking him a playoff record 9 times.
Four different Chiefs defensive players (Albert Lewis, Joe Phillips, Bennie Thompson, and Derrick Thomas) finished the game with multiple sacks, three of whom (all except Thomas) didn't have 2 sacks during the entire season.
On the opening drive of the game, a heavy pass rush by Oilers defensive tackle Glenn Montgomery caused Montana to throw a rushed pass that was intercepted by Steve Jackson, who returned it 14 yards to the Chiefs 23-yard line.
Houston went three-and-out, including Lewis' 9-yard sack of Moon on third down, but Al Del Greco kicked a 49-yard field goal to put them on the board.
Then after forcing a punt, Moon led the Oilers 80 yards in 11 plays on a drive that consumed just 6:37, starting if off with a 16-yard completion to Gary Wellman and later completing a 30-yard pass to Wellman deep in Chiefs territory.

Running back Gary Brown took the ball into the end zone from there, increasing Houston's lead to 10–0.
In the second quarter, Chiefs receiver Danan Hughes gave his team a big opportunity by returning a punt 35 yards to the Oilers 42-yard line.
But Kansas City ended up empty handed at the end of a drive in which they squandered multiple chances to get into scoring range.
First, Montana threw a pass to the end zone that was barely deflected away from receiver Willie Davis by the outstretched arm of defensive back Cris Dishman.
On the next play, he completed a pass to J. J. Birden that moved the ball to the 5-yard line, only to see it wiped out by a false start penalty on tackle John Alt.
Then after a screen pass that gained nothing, Montana thew another pass to the end zone on third down, this one bouncing off the fingertips of a wide open Davis and forcing Kansas City to punt.
Houston then drove to the Chiefs 10-yard line on a drive that included Moon's 16-yard scramble with an unnecessary roughness penalty turning it into a 31-yard gain.
But after a penalty pushed them back to the 25, they too failed to score when Lewis knocked the ball out of Moon's hand as he pulled it back to throw and rookie linebacker Jaime Fields recovered the fumble.
Montana completed a 22-yard pass to Davis on the first play after the turnover, and eventually the Chiefs reached the Houston 36-yard line.

In the fourth period, Houston defensive back Terry Hoage intercepted a pass from Montana at the Chiefs 25-yard line, setting up Del Greco's 43-yard field goal to make the score 13–7.
But Kansas City quickly stormed back to take their first lead of the game, scoring in just three plays: A 22-yard completion from Montana to Cash, a 38-yard pass interference penalty against Houston, and Montana's 11-yard touchdown pass to Birden.
Then on the first play of Houston's ensuing drive, Thomas forced a fumble from Moon that defensive lineman Dan Saleaumua recovered on the Oilers 13-yard line, setting up Montana's 18-yard touchdown pass to Davis.
Moon then led the Oilers 80 yards with 8 consecutive completions, including a 23-yard catch by Jeffries, to score on wide receiver Ernest Givins' 7-yard touchdown reception, making the score 21–20 with 3:35 left.
But the Chiefs responded with a critical 41-yard completion from Montana to Cash on 3rd and 1, setting up Marcus Allen's game clinching 21-yard touchdown run.
Houston would not host another playoff game until 2011 and the franchise would not appear in the playoffs until 1999, their first season as the Tennessee Titans.

After a Kansas City punt, a pair of double digit runs by Thomas set up a second Christie field goal to make the score 20–6 with just over 2 minutes left in the half.
The Chiefs responded with a drive to the Buffalo 5-yard line, featuring a 31-yard completion from Joe Montana to running back Todd McNair, but with 21 seconds left before halftime, Montana's pass went through the hands of Kimble Anders and was intercepted by Bills defensive back Henry Jones.
Montana later suffered a concussion during the third play of the third quarter and left the game, replaced by Dave Krieg.
Krieg's first two passes were incomplete, resulting in a punt that Copeland returned 26 yards into KC territory, but the Chiefs defense rose to the occasion and forced a punt.
Krieg then led his team on a 90-yard drive, starting out with a 26-yard completion to J. J. Birden and later completing a 19-yarder to tight end Keith Cash on 4th down and 2, to score on 1-yard touchdown run by Allen.
However, Buffalo scored 10 unanswered points in the final period to preserve the victory.
First they responded to the Chiefs touchdown with an 18-yard field goal by Christie.
Then a sack by Phil Hansen forced Kansas City to punt, and Copeland again gave his team good field position with a return to the Bills 48-yard line, where the team started a 52-yard drive to put the game away on Thomas' 3-yard touchdown run.
For the Bills, this was the third straight year they defeated a future Hall of Fame quarterback to advance to the Super Bowl.
They beat John Elway and his Denver Broncos in the 1991 AFC Championship game and Dan Marino and his Miami Dolphins in 1992.
For Montana, this was his seventh start in a conference championship game, the most of any quarterback, breaking his tie with Terry Bradshaw and Roger Staubach (In 2013, Tom Brady surpassed Montana by starting in his eighth AFC Championship Game.)
He also joined the select group to start in the conference championship for two different franchises, joining Craig Morton (Cowboys and Broncos), Doug Williams (Buccaneers and Redskins) and Jay Schroeder (Redskins and Raiders).
This was also Jim Kelly's fifth Conference Championship game which is tied for fifth most with Ken Stabler, John Elway, Tom Brady, Brett Favre and Donovan McNabb.
Copeland finished with 138 all-purpose yards, including 5 punt returns for 70.
It was the first AFC Championship Game that was a rematch of a previous AFL Championship Game, the former taking place in 1966.
