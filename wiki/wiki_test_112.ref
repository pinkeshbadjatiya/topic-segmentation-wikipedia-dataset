Following its Toronto International Film Festival premiere, "El Cantante" earned mostly negative reviews from critics and currently holds a 25% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 106 reviews.
Robert Koehler of "Variety" felt that the biopic, which contained "many standard-issue biopic montage sequences", was only "geared for the bigscreen, but the fairly bland visual design will make pic more than suitable to be seen on the tube".
Koehler was critical of both performances, feeling that while Lopez brought "plenty of ferocity" to her character, there wasn't "shape" or "power" to her "wrath", and labeled Anthony "the dullest of movie drug addicts".
A.O.
Scott of "The New York Times" felt that Anthony as Lavoe was hidden behind "his high, delicate cheekbones and tinted glasses" but "Whenever Héctor takes the stage, however, Mr. Anthony unleashes his charisma, and shows that, whatever his limitations as an actor, he is a brilliant performer".
Scott praised Lopez's performance, noting that it had "a lot of fight" with "a hard, skeptical edge" that made Puchi "a more interesting and plausible character than her husband".
Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film and Anthony's performance a positive review, but was critical of Lopez, calling her performance "predictably self-conscious" but said her sequences "complements Puchi's own".
Renee Schonfield of Common Sense Media gave "El cantante" a negative review, "brings the magic of salsa music to the screen; unfortunately, it also brings the audience another bleak story of a flameout singer bent on self-destruction".
Kevin Maher of "The Times" was negative, stating that the "soft-pedalled account of Lavoe's rise to fame and his drug-related downfall that has more in common with the biopic parody Walk Hard than anything as muddy as real life".
Claudia Puig of "USA Today" said Anthony "gives a fine and impassioned performance" in a story that "relies on formula and clichés of the genre" which meant "we don't learn enough about what caused the Puerto Rican-born Lavoe's downward spiral into drug use, promiscuity and suicide attempts after he gained fame in New York City".
Additionally, Puig criticized Lopez's airtime by stating "the film has far too much of her and not enough of Anthony".
Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian", in a review based primarily on Lopez, panned her performance and said "There is something entirely dead about Lopez's performance.
No matter how superficially lively she makes it, she is always simply mouthing the lines".
On the other hand, Charlotte O'Sullivan of the "Evening Standard" praised Lopez and her character, "Lopez deserves praise for pushing this project.
The recently deceased Puchi (who helped generate the script and pushed for Lopez to play her) is not the kind of character you see on screen every day.
She has not been whitewashed and neither, thank goodness, has her husband".
