Bajaga i Instruktori
Bajaga i Instruktori (Serbian Cyrillic: Бајага и Инструктори; trans.
"Bajaga and the Instructors") are a highly popular Serbian and former Yugoslav rock band.
Founded in Belgrade in 1984 by composer, lyricist and guitarist Momčilo Bajagić "Bajaga", the group possesses a rich discography and a plethora of hit songs that placed them at the top of the former Yugoslav rock scene, alongside other mega-selling bands such as Bijelo Dugme and Riblja Čorba.
==========
The band's history begins in 1983.
At the time Momčilo Bajagić "Bajaga" was the guitarist for the hard rock band Riblja Čorba.
During his work with Riblja Čorba, Bajagić wrote music and both music and lyrics for several Riblja Čorba hits, but also wrote a large number of humorous pop-oriented songs that did not fit into Riblja Čorba's sound.
He decided to release these songs on a solo album, and he started working on the album with a group of Belgrade musicians: vocalist Dejan Cukić (a former Dizel, Tilt, and Bulevar member, and at the time a journalist working in the magazine "Rock"), bass guitarist Miroslav Cvetković "Cvele" (a former Tilt, Pop Mašina, and Papatra member), guitarist Nenad Stamatović (a former Tilt, Zebra, Suncokret, and Bulevar member), and drummer Vladimir Golubović (a former Tilt and Suncokret member, at the time temporarily replacing Vicko Milatović in Riblja Čorba).
During the work on the album, Bajagić wanted only to record a large number of songs he wrote on an album and to remain a member of Riblja Čorba.
The songs for the album were recorded in a rented apartment and in Radio Television Belgrade Studio V and produced by Kornelije Kovač.
The album, beside mentioned musicians, featured Nenad Stefanović "Japanac" on bass guitar, a former Generacija 5 member Dragan "Krle" Jovanović on guitar, Kire Mitrev on trombone, Ivan Švager on clarinet, and Suzana Petričević on vocals in the song "Papaline" ("Sprats").
The album, entitled "Pozitivna geografija" ("Positive Geography") was released at the end of January 1984 and was well received by the audience, bringing hits "Berlin", "Mali slonovi" ("Little Elephants"), "Poljubi me" ("Kiss Me"), "Limene trube" ("Brass Trumpets"), "Tekila gerila" ("Tequila Guerrilla"), "Marlena", and "Tamara".
The album also featured the anti-drug song "Znam čoveka" ("I Know a Man"), dedicated to Dragan Đerić "Đera", Bajagić's former bandmate from the bands Ofi and Glogov Kolac.
Initially, Bajagić had no intention of promoting "Pozitivna geografija" in concert, but eventually decided to listen to the advices of some and hold several concerts.
Bajagić and musicians working on the album held their first concert in Zagreb club Kulušić on April 12, 1984.
Beside the musicians that worked on the album, the concert also featured vocalist Žika Milenković (Bajagić's former bandmate from the band Ofi, and a former Mačori member and an actor in the amateur theatre Teatar levo), keyboardist Dragan Mitrić (a former Bulevar member) and Kornelije Kovač, Milenković soon becoming an official member of the band.
During their staying in Zagreb Bajagić and Cukić appeared as guests on the recording of Parni Valjak album "Uhvati ritam", singing backing vocals on the title track, which was the sign of gratitude to Parni Valjak for lending them a piece of drum kit for their first concert.
The band held the official album promotion, organized by the "Rock" magazine, in Belgrade Dom Sindikata on April 21, and on this concert the band appeared under the name Bajaga i Instruktori, chosen after the idea of the journalist Peca Popović, for the first time.
The concert featured Valentino and Bezobrazno Zeleno as the opening bands.
The concert was well visited (mostly by teenagers) and the band's performance was well received.
The success of Bajagić's solo album caused conflicts inside Riblja Čorba, and on July 19, 1984, he was excluded from the band.
During that summer Bajaga i Instruktori went on a tour, with Rade Radivojević on keyboards, playing mostly at youth work actions.
At the end of the year, in the "Rock" magazine, Bajagić was proclaimed the Rock Musician of the Year, and "Pozitivna geografija" was voted the Album of the Year by musicians.
At the beginning of 1985, the band recorded the album "Sa druge strane jastuka" ("On the Other Side of the Pillow"), produced by Kornelije Kovač and Saša Habić.
The album featured a large number of guests: Branko Mačić on jazz guitar, Stjepko Gut on trumpet and flugelhorn, Sava Medan on double bass, Jovan Maljoković on saxophone, Mića Marković on saxophone, Nenad Stefanović "Japanac" on bass guitar, Dragan "Krle" Jovanović on guitar, and others.
The album brought hits "220 u voltima" ("220 Volt"), "Vidi šta mi je uradio od pesme, mama" (a Serbian language cover of the Melanie Safka song "Look What They've Done to My Song Ma"), "Ti se ljubiš (Na tako dobar način)" ("You Kiss (In a great Manner)"), "Dvadeseti vek" ("Twentieth Century"), and ballads "Dobro jutro, džezeri" ("Good Morning, Jazzers"), "Sa druge strane jastuka" and "Zažmuri" ("Close Your Eyes").
For the first time Milenković was an author of a song, co-writing the song "Francuska ljubavna revolucija" ("French Love Revolution") with Bajagić.
At this time the band's manager became a former U Škripcu menager Saša Dragić.
In March, Bajaga i Instruktori presented their new songs to the Zagreb audience in Kulušić, as a part of the "BG-ZG: Bolje vas našli" action.
Several days later, in the night between March 9 and 10, they performed in Toulouse on the Night of Mediterranean Rock.
Although they performed around 4:00 AM, they were well received and performed three encores.
After this concert Rade Radivojević left the band, and was replaced by a former Potop and Galija member Saša Lokner.
The band went on a successful Yugoslav tour, on which they held two concerts on Tašmajdan Stadium, on June 8 and 9.
In May 1985, Bajagić and Cukić took a part in YU Rock Misija, a Yugoslav contribution to Live Aid, and on June 15, Bajaga i Instruktori performed on the YU Rock Misija concert held on the Red Star Stadium.
In the autumn of 1985, Bajaga i Instruktori and Bijelo Dugme performed on the Moscow Festival of Youth and Students, as a part of Yugoslav delegation.
Bajaga i Instruktori performed in the Gorky Park in front of about 100,000 people, and, as there was a serious risk of attendants getting hurt, the concert was interrupted.
During the following days the band performed in the Moscow Dinamo Hall, Green Theatre (with the bands Misty in Roots and Everything but the Girl), Pioneers Home, and Vakhtangov Theatre.
After they returned to Yugoslavia they continued their tour on which they held more than 120 concerts.
The band also performed on the rock evening of the Intertalent Festival in Prague.
At the end of 1985, in the magazine "Rock", Bajaga i Instruktori were voted by the critics the Rock Band of the Year, Bajagić the Rock Musician of the Year, "Zažmuri" the Song of the Year, and "Sa druge strane jastuka" the Album of the Year.
The album was sold in more than 350,000 copies, and the band was awarded with the May 25 award by the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia.
The band went on a break during which Lokner and Golubović performed in jazz clubs with jazz musicians Stjepko Gut (trumpet), Miša Krstić (piano), and Nenad Petrović (saxophone).
In the summer of 1986, the band members reunited to record the album "Jahači magle" ("Fog Riders").
The album, produced by Saša Habić featured numerous guests: Josipa Lisac on vocals in "Ja mislim 300 na sat" ("I Think at 300 kmph"), Kornelije Kovač, bass guitarist Bata Božanić, guitarists Duda Bezuha, Rajko Kojić (Bajagić's former bandmate from Riblja Čorba), Vlada Negovanović, and Jane Parđovski, trumpeter Goran Grbić, and keyboardist Đorđe Petrović.
The band recorded a cover of The Beatles song "All You Need Is Love", entitled "All You Need Is Love (verzija 1986)" ("All You Need Is Love (Version 1986)") which was released on a 7" single given as a gift with an issue of "Rock magazine" before the album release.
The B-side featured clips from the songs from "Jahači magle".
The single was printed in 99,999 copies.
After the single release, the album was released, bringing hits "Ja mislim 300 na sat", "442 do Beograda" ("442 to Belgrade"), with a bass guitar riff written by Božanić, "Bam, Bam, Bam", "Rimljani" ("Romans"), and Milenković's "Samo nam je ljubav potrebna" ("All We Need Is Love").
The band went on a successful tour, which ended with a concert held at Belgrade's Sajmište on November 22, 1986, in front of about 20,000 visitors.
After the end of a tour the band made a break once again.
Bajagić travelled to Thailand, and in June 1987 Cukić released his first solo album "Spori ritam" ("Slow Rhythm").
After that, Bajaga i Instruktori went on a two months Soviet Union tour, during which they held 42 concerts.
After they returned to Yugoslavia, Cukić left Bajaga i Instruktori conventionally and formed his Spori Ritam Band.
Bajaga i Instruktori recorded their following album "Prodavnica tajni" ("The Shop of Secrets") in 1988 in Novi Sad.
The album, named after Dino Buzzati book "La boutique del mistero", (the songs, however, had no connection with the book), was produced by Saša Habić.
Milenković co-wrote the songs "Ruski voz" ("Russian Train"), "Život je nekad siv, nekad žut" ("Life Is Sometimes Grey and Sometimes Yellow"), and "Vesela pesma" ("Merry Song").
The album marked a slight stylistic change in the band's sound: the songs were simpler, without brass instruments, frequent on the band's previous releases, based on acoustic guitars and keyboards, and the songs "Plavi safir" ("Blue Sapphire"), "Vesela pesma", "Život je nekad siv, nekad žut" and "Ruski voz" featured folk music elements.
However, virtually every song on the album became a hit.
The band went on another successful tour, during which they recorded the double live/compilation album "Neka svemir čuje nemir" ("May the Universe Hear the Unrest").
The album featured new songs "Na vrhovima prstiju" ("On the Tips of Your Toes"), "Idem (Kao da ne idem, a idem)" ("I'm Going (Like I'm not Going, but I'm Going"), which is the first Bajaga i Instruktori song sung entirely by Milenković, and "Neka svemir čuje nemir", which is a cover of a traditional Indian song, and acoustic studio versions of "Tamara" and "Tekila gerila".
The live recordings were made during the band's concerts in Zagreb's Dom Sportova, held on March 6, 1989, and from Novi Sad EBU Rock Festival, and also a recording of the journalist Dražen Vrdoljak announcing the band on their concert in Kulušić, held on December 8, 1984.
The album also featured a live version of the song "Kad hodaš", written by Bajagić and originally recorded by Riblja Čorba.
During the tour that followed the album release the band held two sold out concerts in Belgrade's Pionir Hall.
Despite the growing nationalism the band was well accepted in all parts of Yugoslavia.
The only incident on the tour happened in Split, where the fans of the football club Hajduk Split threw various objects on the stage, but after the intervention of the security the concert was continued.
At the beginning of 1990, Bajaga i Instruktori performed in Timişoara, Romania, at a rock festival organized two months after the fall of Nicolae Ceauşescu.
The festival also featured several less known British acts and Yugoslav acts Riblja Čorba, Valentino, Galija and Viktorija.
