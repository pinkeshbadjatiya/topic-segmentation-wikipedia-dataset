USA Women's U18 and U19 teams
The USA Women's U18 and U19 teams are two of the teams under the auspices of the USA Basketball organization.
The team names refer to the age limits for the invited players.
The events were originally referred to as the FIBA Americas Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament and the FIBA Junior World Championship.
The usual sequence is for the U18 team to play in a regional championship in one year, with the top four qualifying teams being invited to a World Championship in the following year, as the U19 team.
The first Junior World Championship was held in 1985, without a qualifying tournament in the prior year.
Starting in 1988, the events were on a four-year cycle, with the FIBA Americas Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament in 1988, followed by the FIBA Junior World Championship in 1989.
This continued until the format was changed in 2006.
Now, the U18 team plays in the U18 Americas event every other year, and the U19 World event in subsequent years.
The U18 team becomes the U19 team, with largely the same players and coaches, although changes can occur.
For example, while Debbie Ryan served as head coach for the 1988 U18 team, and again as head coach for the 1989 U19 team, the head coach for the 1992 U18 team was Nancy Wilson, but changed to Jim Foster for the 1993 U19 team.
There are also changes in the playing roster, although many of the players on the U18 team go on to play on the U19 team.
The U18 Americas Championship was held in July 2008.
Players were eligible for the U18 and U19 teams in those years if they were born on 1 January 1990 or later.
The USA won the gold, winning all five games.
The result qualified the U19 team for the World Championships in July/August 2009 in Thailand, where the USA lost their opening game against Spain, but went on to win every subsequent game, including the gold medal rematch against Spain.
The 2010 U18 Americas Championship was held in Colorado Springs, Colorado USA, in July 2010.
The 2011 U19 World Championship was held in Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas, Chile in July, 2011.
The USA team won the gold medal in each event.

The team was finalized following the game, with twelve players identified to compete in the World Championships in Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas, Chile in July.
The USA selection committee chose the team members to represent the USA.
The twelve players selected were:
The opening game for the USA team was against Japan, who started out with a very early lead, 5–2.

However, both teams played to win, and Argentina took an early lead 7–3.
However, a balanced offense proved too much for the Argentine team.
With eleven of the twelve USA players scoring between five and twelve points, led by Breanna Stewart on 3–3 shooting from the field, the USA team had too much offense and defense.

Ariel Massengale was the only USA player to score in double-digits with 17 points.
In contrast, Canada had three double-digit scorers, led by 24 points for Michelle Plouffe.

The USA team came back, but was still down 30–25 at halftime.
The USA team cut into the lead in the third quarter, but with one quarter to go, France led 49–47.
Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, who would score nine of her thirteen points in the final quarter, helped the USA take the lead, and the USA team pulled out to an eleven-point lead with just over six minutes to play.
